== Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes::
an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

How can containers within a pod communicate with each other::
Containers within a pod share networking space and can reach other on localhost. For instance, if you have two containers within a pod, a MySQL container running on port 3306, and a PHP container running on port 80, the PHP container could access the MySQL one through localhost:3306.

What does a Pod do::
Pods represent the processes running on a cluster.
By limiting pods to a single process, Kubernetes can report on the health of each process running in the cluster. Pods have:

* a unique IP address (which allows them to communicate with each other)
* persistent storage volumes (as required)
* configuration information that determine how a container should run.

Although most pods contain a single container, many will have a few containers that work closely together to execute a desired function.

Pods usage patterns::

Pods can be used in two main ways:

* *Pods that run a single container*

The simplest and most common Pod pattern is a single container per pod, where the single container represents an entire application. In this case, you can think of a Pod as a wrapper.

* *Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together*.

Pods with multiple containers are primarily used to support colocated, co-managed programs that need to share resources. These colocated containers might form a single cohesive unit of service—one container serving files from a shared volume while another container refreshes or updates those files. The Pod wraps these containers and storage resources together as a single manageable entity.

Each Pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application. If you want to run multiple instances, you should use one Pod for each instance of the application. This is generally referred to as _*replication*_. Replicated Pods are created and managed as a group by a controller, such as a Deployment.

What is a Master Node and what component does it consist of::

*Master Node*

* The master node is the most vital component responsible for Kubernetes architecture
* It is the central controlling unit of Kubernetes and manages workload and communications across the clusters

Components:

* ETCD
* Controller Manager
* Scheduler
* API Server

.ETCD (Cluster store)
****

    border-width: 10
* This component stores the configuration details and essential values
* It communicates with all other components to receive the commands and work in order to perform an action
* It also manages network rules and posts forwarding activity
****

*Controller Manager*

* It is responsible for most of the controllers and performs a task
* It is a daemon which runs in a continuous loop and is responsible for collecting and sending information to API server
* The key controllers handle nodes, endpoints, etc.

*Scheduler*

* It is one of the key components of the master node associated with the distribution of workload
* The scheduler is responsible for workload utilization and allocating pod to a new node
* The scheduler should have an idea of the total resources available as well as resources allocated to existing workloads on each node

What are namespaces?::

* allow you split your cluster into virtual clusters where you can group your applications in a way that makes sense and is completely separated from the other groups (so you can for example create an app with the same name in two different namespaces).

* When using the default namespace alone, it becomes hard over time to get an overview of all the applications you manage in your cluster. Namespaces make it easier to organize the applications into groups that makes sense, like a namespace of all the monitoring applications and a namespace for all the security applications, etc.

Namespaces can also be useful for managing Blue/Green environments where each namespace can include a different version of an app and also share resources that are in other namespaces (namespaces like logging, monitoring, etc.).

Another use case for namespaces is one cluster, multiple teams. When multiple teams use the same cluster, they might end up stepping on each others toes. For example if they end up creating an app with the same name it means one of the teams overriden the app of the other team because there can't be too apps in Kubernetes with the same name (in the same namespace).

What does it mean that "pods are ephemeral"?::

* Pods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever, and when a Pod is terminated it cannot be brought back. In general, Pods do not disappear until they are deleted by a user or by a controller.

* Pods do not "heal" or repair themselves. For example, if a Pod is scheduled on a node which later fails, the Pod is deleted. Similarly, if a Pod is evicted from a node for any reason, the Pod does not replace itself.

What happens when a master fails? What happens when a worker fails?::

Kubernetes is designed to be *resilient* to any individual node failure, master or worker.

* When a master fails the nodes of the cluster will keep operating, but there can be no changes including pod creation or service member changes until the master is available.
* When a worker fails, the master stops receiving messages from the worker. If the master does not receive status updates from the worker the node will be marked as NotReady. If a node is *NotReady* for 5 minutes, the master reschedules all pods that were running on the dead node to other available nodes.

What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?::
When using Kubernetes, most of the time you don’t care how your pods are scheduled, but sometimes you care that pods are deployed in order, that they have a persistent storage volume, or that they have a unique, stable network identifier across restarts and reschedules. In those cases, StatefulSets can help you accomplish your objective.

* It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following:

* Stable, unique network identifiers.
* Stable, persistent storage.
* Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
* Ordered, automated rolling updates.
