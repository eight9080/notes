= Kubernetes

== Core concepts

Kubernetes, K8s, is an open‑source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

management of the containers, eliminate single points of failure in our application, scale containers easily, and update containers without actually even bringing down the running application

robust networking infrastructure so that containers can talk to other containers, even across different machines.

some storage options across machines

=== Key features
* Service discovery/ Load balancing
* Storage orchestration
* Automate Rollouts/Rollbacks - a zero downtime deployment
* Self-healing
* Secret and configuration management - ConfigMaps can be used to store key value pairs
* Horizontal scaling

Kubernetes provides a declared way to define a *cluster's state*
Current state -> desired state

One or more master nodes -> it will call worker nodes. +
The worker nodes can be physical servers/ virtual machines.(they will form a cluster). +
A node is just a virtual machine, and it can run one or more pods.

The master will start on each of these nodes -> *pods*.

A pod - a way to host a container, the packaging.

Deployments and replica sets - a way to deploy the pods.

Services - to enable pods to communicate possibly with the outside world or just amongst themselves within the cluster.

On master:

*etcd store* on our master nodes - the database for everything the master node needs to track.

A *Controller manager* - responsible for when a request comes in, the manager can act upon that request and schedule it using a *scheduler*

*The scheduler* will determine when the nodes and the different pods running on the nodes actually come to life or go away.

To interact with the master to give it instructions to go from one state to another by using a command line tool called *kubectl*
Kubectl is just making your different types of RESTful service calls to send these before and after state requests to the master.

On each node:

* a little agent installed and running on each node that registers that node with the cluster and reports back and forth to the manager. That's called the *kubelet*

* container runtime - to run our containers within the pods

* networking capabilities - a *kube‑proxy* that can ensure that each pod gets a unique IP address
