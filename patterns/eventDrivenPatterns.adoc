= Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

Message brokers provide different event delivery guarantees:

* At-most-once delivery +
The event is delivered to the consumer only once or not at all. If the consumer is not online during a delivery attempt or if network failures occur, the consumer will not get the event. Most important, the message broker will not try to send the same event again.

* At-least-once delivery +
The event is guaranteed to be delivered to the consumer. However, the consumer may consume the same event multiple times because if the message broker does not get an acknowledgment from the consumer for the event delivery, it will assume that the consumer did not receive the event and will resend it. In this case, the consumer should be intelligent enough *to handle duplicate events*.

*Exactly Once Processing*

* by injecting sequence numbers to the events so consumers can identify and drop duplicate events before processing them.

* when events are *idempotent*: the outcome of receiving the same event multiple times is no different from receiving the event only once.

== Message Broker Categories

* Standard (store-backed) message brokers

** store events in a data store to enable serving to intended consumers.
** purge events from their store upon delivery to consumers.
** Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ

* Log-based message brokers

** store events in commit logs.
** The events persist even beyond their being consumed.
** allow consumers to replay events from a previous point in time.
** Apache Kafka and NATS

=== CloudEvents

* provides a common standard for describing events that enable interoperability across cloud native applications

* provides a common structure for the event with required attributes such as event ID, source, spec version, and type, and optional attributes such as data content type, schema, subject, and time.

== Event-Delivery Patterns

=== Producer-Consumer Pattern

* enables producer applications and consumer applications to communicate asynchronously by using event queues

1. *Provide asynchronous event delivery*

    Pass events to another application without blocking

2. *Process each event by a single application*

    Using event queues ensures that events are not delivered to multiple consumers.

3. *Ensure event delivery*

 Decouple the applications through queues so consumers will be guaranteed to fetch the events eventually.

4. *Handle sudden bursts of events*

 Can queue and process events without extensively scaling consumers.

5. *Share workload with fairness*

=== Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

* enables applications to communicate asynchronously by using topics. The topic delivers every event to every subscriber.

* a durable subscription, which guarantees that all messages are delivered to all the consumers at least once, accounting for subscribers who are temporarily unavailable.

Usage:

* Broadcast events - to send a notification of all tweets published about sports with #sports (the topic) to all users who have subscribed to that hashtag

* Deliver events with best effort -  events produced by publishers have the at-most-once delivery guarantee. e.g. status updatesâ€”like publishing current weather periodically

* Make sure all events are delivered to all subscribers - use durable subscriptions to ensure that subscribers receive missed events when they are online again.

* Selectively deliver events to subscribers - leverage hierarchical topics or use filtering logic

* Share workloads

To retrieve missed events, subscribers must persist the last-processed event sequence ID, and during restart, they request the message broker to replay all the events since the last-processed sequence ID. This allows the system to achieve a higher delivery guarantee.

=== Fire and Forget Pattern

* clients (producers) send events to respective consumers (services) with an *at-most-once delivery* guarantee *without the use of a message broker*

When a client publishes an event to the service, it expects only an acknowledgment of the event by a relevant HTTP status code such as 202 Accepted.

These events become outdated when their processing is delayed. Instead, processing more-recent events is significantly more valuable. The Fire and Forget pattern enables us to quickly discard events and pick up the next one for processing.

=== Store and Forward Pattern

* clients to send events to services with an *at-least-once delivery* guarantee.
* does not use message brokers but uses APIs to directly send events.

* The client first *persists the events to a durable store*, such as a database or queue in a message broker, before attempting to send them to the service
* Upon successful event delivery, the client purges the events from the store
* If delivery is unsuccessful, it retries to send the event.

Usage:

* Deliver events to services that do not support subscription
* Ensure event delivery during service unavailability

Solutions:

*  use a separate durable store (database or queue) for each client application, when possible,

* using a common event queue for all five clients to store the events. This allows us to distribute the events among the clients when they try to send events to the services

* use databases as the durable store, and still want to use multiple clients for event delivery, you must solve the problem of deciding which client publishes which event. We need to prevent multiple clients loading the same order event from the database and delivering it to the service. This causes *duplicate events* and risks overloading the service. To overcome this, we elect a single client to deliver a particular subset of events (for example, based on the *hash of the event* order number)

=== Polling Pattern

* enables clients such as web browsers to initiate a long-running job, periodically checking completion.

Steps:

* The frontend client or browser sends a request to initiate the process
* the backend service immediately sends an acknowledgment stating that it has accepted the request and initiated the asynchronous job processing( it sends a job ID)
*  the client periodically queries the backend to check if the claim processing has completed
*  Upon completion, the backend returns the results as part of the response to the query, or provides a redirection to an endpoint containing the results.

Usage:

* Retrieve results from a long-running process that cannot notify of job completion
* Deliver events to a client that cannot initiate subscription or callbacks

Not recommend using this pattern when the application supports callbacks such as webhooks or WebSockets for communication

image::pollingPattern.png[Polling pattern]

=== Request Callback Pattern

* enables applications to communicate asynchronously. The application provides the callback information with the request so responses can be delivered to the given callback.

==== WebSockets

* client/server - capability to communicate via the WebSocket protocol
* The client initiates the connection to the service and establishes a long-running connection. Both the client and service persist the connection and communicate by sending events.

* WebSocket is an HTTP-based technology, but HTTP2 and gRPC also provide similar callback-based communication.
* GraphQL uses WebSocket with its subscription feature, allowing clients to connect to a service and listen to real-time events according to the GraphQL query submitted when subscribing.

==== Webhooks

* the client application issues a request and has the response delivered to a callback endpoint
* The client sends the request with a callback URL

image::callback.png[Callback]

Implementations:

* WebSub - This open protocol

WebSub uses Publisher, Hub, and Subscriber microservices and uses HTTP for communication. The publishers publish content to the hub, via HTTP calls and by using HTTP headers to denote the topic information. The subscribers discover the hubs for their interested topic and make an HTTP POST request to the hub with their topic and callback URL. They will then get served with the relevant content through the HTTP POST calls by the hub, as the hub gets new data.

* recommend using webhooks over WebSocket when the client is expecting only a single response, and when the response time cannot be determined or if the response can take more than a few minutes

== State Management Patterns

=== Event Sourcing Pattern

* enables us to store all changes to the application state as a sequence of events
* to re-create application state at various points in time, and with different domain models
* an audit history

Every time an event updates the application state, the event is also recorded in a persistence store in the order of operation

Events are usually stored on a commit log, such as Apache Kafka, which allows us to read the events back from any point in time in a sequential manner by passing event sequence IDs.

When using an event log as the source of truth, the recovery of system failure can take a long time; we need to re-create the application state by replaying all the events in the event log. To improve recovery time, we can periodically take *application state snapshots*

When defining the events for a commit log, they should be modeled as *change events*.

Not use this pattern for use cases that do not tolerate eventual consistency

*The Event Sourcing pattern is inherently complex to implement and maintain, especially with a changing event schema, and with multiple external services communicating. We recommend using this pattern only if rebuilding an applicationâ€™s state, or different domain models, is essential.*

=== Summary

The event schema changes in a continuous manner. +
We need all consuming applications to have data in a consistent state at all times.

|Allows consumers to build application state optimized for their domain models and access patterns. +
Replicates the data into multiple applications, thereby increasing availability. +
Supports system recovery with event replay.
