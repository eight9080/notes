== Context and problem
=== Orchestrator pattern

A cloud-based application is divided into several small services that work together to process a business transaction end-to-end. +
To lower coupling between services, each service is responsible for a single business operation. Some *benefits* include faster development, smaller code base, and scalability.

The services communicate with each other by using *well-defined APIs*. Even a single business operation can result in *multiple point-to-point calls* among all services.

_A common pattern for communication is to use a centralized service that acts as the *orchestrator*._  +
It acknowledges all incoming requests and delegates operations to the respective services. In doing so, it also manages the workflow of the entire business transaction. Each service just completes an operation and is not aware of the overall workflow.

The orchestrator pattern *reduces point-to-point communication between services* but has some *drawbacks because of the tight coupling between the orchestrator and other services* that participate in processing of the business transaction.

* To execute tasks in a sequence, the orchestrator needs to have some domain knowledge about the responsibilities of those services.
* If you want to add or remove services, existing logic will break, and you'll need to rewire portions of the communication path.
* While you can configure the workflow, add or remove services easily with a well-designed orchestrator, such an implementation is complex and hard to maintain.

== Solution

Let each service decide when and how a business operation is processed, instead of depending on a central orchestrator.

One way to implement choreography is to use the *asynchronous messaging pattern* to coordinate the business operations.

[.left.text-center]
image::choreography.png[choreography pattern]

* A client request publishes messages to a message queue.
* As messages arrive, they are pushed to subscribers, or services, interested in that message.
* Each subscribed service does their operation as indicated by the message and responds to the message queue with success or failure of the operation.
**  In case of success, the service can push a message back to the same queue or a different message queue so that another service can continue the workflow if needed.
** If an operation fails, the message bus can retry that operation.

Pros and cons:
* The services choreograph the workflow among themselves without depending on an orchestrator or having direct communication between them.
* This pattern helps reduce coupling between services.
* It can remove the performance bottleneck caused by the orchestrator when it has to deal with all transactions.

== When to use this pattern

* if you expect to update, remove, or add new services frequently. The entire app can be modified with lesser effort and minimal disruption to existing services.

* if you experience performance bottlenecks in the central orchestrator.

* Services can spin up because of an event, do their task, and are removed when the task is finished.

== Issues and considerations

Decentralizing the orchestrator can cause issues while managing the workflow.

If a service fails to complete a business operation, it can be difficult to recover from that failure.

* One way is to have the service indicate failure by firing an event. Another service subscribes to those failed events takes necessary actions such as applying *compensating transactions* to undo successful operations in a request.
* The failed service might also fail to fire an event for the failure. In that case, consider using a retry and, or time out mechanism to recognize that operation as a failure.

The choreography pattern becomes a challenge if the number of services grow rapidly. Given the high number of independent moving parts, the workflow between services tends to get complex. Also, distributed tracing becomes difficult.

The orchestrator centrally manages the resiliency of the workflow and it can become a single point of failure. On the other hand, for choreography, the role is distributed between all services and resiliency becomes less robust.

Each service must retry transient, nontransient, and time-out failures, so that the request terminates gracefully, if needed. Also, the service must be diligent about communicating the success or failure of the operation so that other services can act accordingly.
