= Monolith

*Weaknesses* associated with monolithic applications:

* Scalability +
Monolithic applications are designed to run on a single and powerful system within a process.

 ** Increasing the application's speed or capacity requires fork lifting onto newer and faster hardware, which takes significant planning and consideration.

* Reliability and availability +
Any kind of faults or bugs within a monolithic application can take the entire application offline. Additionally, updating the application typically requires *downtime* in order to restart services.

* Agility +
Monolithic code bases become increasingly complex as features are being continuously added, and release cycles are usually measured in periods of 6-12 months or more.
