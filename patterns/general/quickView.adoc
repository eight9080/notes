== Object-oriented architecture (OOA)

The structure and behavior of any software application can be represented through the use of multiple and interoperable objects.

Objects elegantly encapsulate the various properties and the tasks in an optimized and organized manner.

Objects connect, communicate, and collaborate through well-defined interfaces.

The properties of *inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and composition* being provided by OOA come in handy in producing highly modular (highly cohesive and loosely coupled), usable and reusable software applications.

== Domain-driven design (DDD) architecture

* designing software based on the business domain, its elements and behaviors, and the relationships between them

As the core of the software is the domain model, which is a direct projection of this shared language, it allows the team to quickly find gaps in the software by analyzing the language around it.
