= Stream-Processing Patterns

A *stream* can be defined as a continuous sequence of events ordered by time. +
All events in a stream have a common message format and structure.

*Stream processing* is performing operations on events in motion. It can be as simple as a stateless service consuming events and transforming its event format, or as complex as storing and processing stateful data in memory with low latency and reliability.

== Streaming Data Processing Patterns

=== Transformation Pattern

* maps the data of one event to another

* Message transformation
 ** custom or Apache Camel, KSQL, Amazon Kinesis, and Azure Stream Analytics

* Protocol switching

=== Filters and Thresholds Pattern

* useful for extracting only the relevant events we need.

Usage:

* Filter events by category
* Apply a threshold for alerting


=== Windowed Aggregation Pattern

* enables us to analyze a collection of events based on a condition

* These windows can be based on the time or event count, such as the last five minutes or the last 100 events. These windows may also have behaviors such as sliding or batching, defining when events are added and removed from the window.

Types: length sliding, length batch, time sliding, and time batch

* The Windowed Aggregation pattern is *stateful*, meaning it stores data related to the events in memory.

Usage:

* Aggregate events over time
* Aggregate events over length

Because windows are collections of events, the most effective way of scaling them is by sharding.

Splitting the incoming events into different windows, aggregating the events in isolation, and then using the Stream Join pattern to build bigger aggregations.

Libraries: Esper or Siddhi

=== Stream Join Pattern

* enables us to join events from multiple streams with different schemas.

* defining a condition to identify the joining events.
*  define a buffer that determines how long events should wait for corresponding events to arrive from other event streams (window)

* The Stream Join pattern is *stateful*, as it buffers events for the join

Usage:

* Scatter and gather - process the same event in parallel, performing different operations, and finally combine the results so all event outputs can be emitted as a single event

* Join various types of events -

=== Temporal Event Ordering Pattern

* tries to detect various interesting complex event occurrences by identifying patterns based on event arrival order.

Example: We detect a continuous stock price increase followed by a single drop, and the user will be notified as soon as the first drop is detected.

A new state machine instance should be initiated upon each event arrival that triggers the initial state of the state machine.

Usage:

* Detect sequence of event occurrence - for identifying an incident by having a sequence of events happen in a prescribed order. (transaction identifying fraud)

* Detect nonoccurrence of event

Stream processing systems like Azure Streaming Analytics, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Esper, and Siddhi are some that can provide this functionality by default.

=== Machine Learner Pattern

* Prebuilt machine learning models

Machine learning frameworks such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, or even Python

* Online machine learning models

These are models that tune themselves based on the information they receive as they produce predictions.

== Scaling and Performance Optimization Patterns

=== Sequential Convoy Pattern

* separating events into various categories and processing them in parallel. It also works to persist event ordering so events can be combined at a later time, while preserving the original order of the events.

Each event also can be labeled with a sequence number before separation. +
This sequencing can also be used to join the parallel streams together at a later time, based on the original event order. We use a merge sort by selecting the smallest sequence number among all the substreams

Usage:

* Scale stream-processing applications - use a simple round-robin strategy to distribute events to multiple substreams, which will process events much faster.

** separate events into different substreams based on hash values of customer IDs. This will process all events belonging to the same customer ID on the same node, improving the chance of cache hits. By reducing the number of customer IDs processed by a single microservice, we further increase cache hits, thereby meeting our performance goals.

* Partition the stream processing

    ** The Sequential Convoy pattern enables us to execute different use cases against the same event stream by partitioning different event types into parallel streams.

A better approach to regrouping events is an *end-of-sequence message*. This can be emitted by the processing applications with the last process message ID in a periodic time interval. This tells us that all IDs before the given end-of-sequence ID have been processed by the upstream applications and that the missing IDs smaller than the last ID are dropped messages. This unblocks the processing of later events.

When grouping based on sequence numbers is not possible, we can simply collect events and publish them to a single topic, and then use the Buffered Event Ordering pattern, to buffer and sort events based on sequence numbers or event timestamps.

=== Buffered Event Ordering Pattern

* allows us to reorder events before processing them downstream. We can order events based on time or on the order they are generated.

* Sequence numbers will continuously increase, and we can guarantee that each event in a stream will have a unique number. But with a timestamp, we cannot guarantee that all events will have unique values, because multiple events can be generated in the same millisecond.

If next event is not next in order:

* wait with a timeout for the event
* the previous processor can send an empty event with sequence number

Usage:

* Order events generated on distributed event sources

The out-of-order events can be sent to a single topic in a message broker, and by using a microservice, those events can be fetched, reordered through the Buffered Event Ordering pattern, and sent downstream for further processing.

* Reorder events generated from the same event sources

* needs to store some events in the buffer while it is waiting for older events to arrive; this means that the microservice has state

=== Course Correction Pattern

* Update results with new

This pattern is commonly used when users are eager to obtain aggregated results quickly. This can especially be useful when we are displaying results in real time on a screen.

* Correct previous decisions

Sometimes we need to make an early decision, and when the situation changes, we send compensation events so that corrective actions can be taken.
(multiple offers accepted - select only one send reject events to the others)

=== Watermark pattern

* useful for periodically aligning stream processing across multiple microservices

* determine whether all microservices have processed all arrived events before a given event, which is commonly referred to as the *watermark event*.

Steps:

*  a watermark generator should generate a watermark event periodically and send it through all the external inputs

*  microservices should pass it through to their dependent systems

* each intermediate microservice that consumes this event can resend it in the same position among the sequence of events

Systems independently generate the watermark events at given intervals, such as once every minute or every five minutes

* When the microservice receives a watermark event in a stream:
 ** it should not continue processing any more events from that stream
 ** process only events from other streams that have not yet received the corresponding watermark event
 ** When we receive all corresponding watermark events on all streams, we can pass that watermark event to all its dependents and continue processing other events from all the input streams until we receive the next watermark event in a stream.

This process is repeated, and this approach ensures that event processing is synchronized at each watermark event.

Usage:

* Synchronize events generated from event sources that are time synchronized

Watermarks can be used to generate synchronized event groups that can produce accurate aggregation results.

image::watermark.png[Watermark]

* Synchronize events generated from nonsynchronized sources

To enforce synchronization, each sensor client can periodically fetch a sequence number from the global counter deployed on a central server and inject it along with the sensor reading.
