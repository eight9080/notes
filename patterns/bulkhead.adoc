= Bulkhead

The Bulkhead pattern is a type of application design that is tolerant of failure. In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function.

== Context and problem

A cloud-based application may include multiple services, with each service having one or more consumers. Excessive load or failure in a service will impact all consumers of the service.

A consumer may send requests to multiple services simultaneously, using resources for each request. When the consumer sends a request to a service that is misconfigured or not responding, the resources used by the client's request may not be freed in a timely manner. As requests to the service continue, those resources may be exhausted. *Eventually the consumer can no longer send requests to other services, not just the original unresponsive service.*

Issue: resource exhaustion

== Solution

Partition service instances into different groups, based on consumer load and availability requirements.

* isolate failures
* sustain service functionality for some consumers even during failure

A consumer can also *partition resources*, to ensure that resources used to call one service don't affect the resources used to call another service.

A consumer that calls multiple services may be assigned *a connection pool for each service*. +
* If a service begins to fail, it only affects the connection pool assigned for that service, allowing the consumer to continue using the other services.

The benefits of this pattern include:

* Isolates consumers and services from *cascading failures*. An issue affecting a consumer or service can be isolated within its own bulkhead, preventing the entire solution from failing.
* Allows you to preserve some functionality in the event of a service failure. Other services and features of the application will continue to work.
* Allows you to deploy services that offer a different quality of service for consuming applications. A high-priority consumer pool can be configured to use high-priority services.

Example: If Service A fails or causes some other issue, the connection pool is isolated, so only workloads using the thread pool assigned to Service A are affected. Workloads that use Service B and C are not affected and can continue working without interruption.

== Issues and considerations

* Consider combining bulkheads with retry, circuit breaker, and throttling patterns to provide more sophisticated fault handling.

* When partitioning consumers into bulkheads, consider using processes, thread pools, and semaphores. Projects like resilience4j and Polly offer a framework for creating consumer bulkheads.

* When partitioning services into bulkheads, consider deploying them into separate virtual machines, containers, or processes. Containers offer a good balance of resource isolation with fairly low overhead.

* Services that communicate using asynchronous messages can be isolated through different sets of queues. Each queue can have a dedicated set of instances processing messages on the queue, or a single group of instances using an algorithm to dequeue and dispatch processing.

== When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to:

* Isolate resources used to consume a set of backend services, especially if the application can provide some level of functionality even when one of the services is not responding.
* Isolate critical consumers from standard consumers.
* Protect the application from cascading failures.
