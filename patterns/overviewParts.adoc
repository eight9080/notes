== Operational Architecture Characteristics

* reliablity

The ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.

* availability

Availability (A) is a ratio of the expected value of the uptime of a system to the aggregate of the expected values of up and down time
Another equation for availability (A) is a ratio of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), or

image::availabilityFormula.png[Formula]

A software system crashed 20 times in an year and for each crash, it takes 2 minutes to restart. Calculate availability in that year

A system has 24/7 (i.e. 'round the clock) availability.
In minutes -> it needs to be available for +
365 (days) * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes) = 525600 minutes.

MTBF - amount of time divided by the number of failures (20). +
MTBF = 525600 / 20 =26280 (minutes MTBF).

Availability = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR) gives:+
26280 (MTBF) / (26280+2) = 0.99992390229054105471425310098166 -
or approx. 99.99% availability.

== Decomposition
=== Service granularity

Granularity disintegrators:

* service functionality
* code volatility
* scalability and throughput
* fault tolerance
* data security

Granularity integrators:

* database transactions
* data dependencies
* workflow and choreography

Problems:

* slow performance due to latency and security
* reliability and data consistency

== Managing flows

Orchestration:

* centralized workflow
* services are generally more tightly coupled due to orchestrator
* less responsiveness and performance
* better control of sagas (state) and error handling

* error handling
* state management


Choreography:

* distributed workflow
* services are generally less coupled (handoffs)
* better responsiveness and performance
* complex saga (state) management and error handling

== Semantic vs syntactic coupling

semantic - work domain

syntatic - how you solve the problem

Strict contract


|===
|+ |-

|guaranteed contract fidelity
|versioning communication

|managed through versioning
|deprecation strategy

|exact contract is known
|brittle and tight coupling

|contains types and constraints
|
|===


Loose contract:

|===
|+ |-

|loose service coupling
|requires fitness functions

|easy to evolve contract
|less certainty in contracts

|always backward compatible
|requires documentation

|immune from implementation changes
|
|===

=== Contract versioning
