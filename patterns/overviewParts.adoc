== Operational Architecture Characteristics

* reliablity

The ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.

* availability

Availability (A) is a ratio of the expected value of the uptime of a system to the aggregate of the expected values of up and down time
Another equation for availability (A) is a ratio of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), or

image::availabilityFormula.png[Formula]

A software system crashed 20 times in an year and for each crash, it takes 2 minutes to restart. Calculate availability in that year

A system has 24/7 (i.e. 'round the clock) availability.
In minutes -> it needs to be available for +
365 (days) * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes) = 525600 minutes.

MTBF - amount of time divided by the number of failures (20). +
MTBF = 525600 / 20 =26280 (minutes MTBF).

Availability = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR) gives:+
26280 (MTBF) / (26280+2) = 0.99992390229054105471425310098166 -
or approx. 99.99% availability.

== Decomposition
=== Service granularity

Granularity disintegrators:

* service functionality
* code volatility
* scalability and throughput
* fault tolerance
* data security

Granularity integrators:

* database transactions
* data dependencies
* workflow and choreography

Problems:

* slow performance due to latency and security
* reliability and data consistency

== Managing flows

Orchestration:

* centralized workflow
* services are generally more tightly coupled due to orchestrator
* less responsiveness and performance
* better control of sagas (state) and error handling

* error handling
* state management


Choreography:

* distributed workflow
* services are generally less coupled (handoffs)
* better responsiveness and performance
* complex saga (state) management and error handling

== Semantic vs syntactic coupling

semantic - work domain

syntatic - how you solve the problem

Strict contract


|===
|+ |-

|guaranteed contract fidelity
|versioning communication

|managed through versioning
|deprecation strategy

|exact contract is known
|brittle and tight coupling

|contains types and constraints
|
|===


Loose contract:

|===
|+ |-

|loose service coupling
|requires fitness functions

|easy to evolve contract
|less certainty in contracts

|always backward compatible
|requires documentation

|immune from implementation changes
|
|===

== Contract versioning

Example json schema
----
{
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
   "title": "Product",
   "description": "A product from Acme's catalog",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
      "id": {
         "description": "The unique identifier for a product",
         "type": "integer"
      },
      "name": {
         "description": "Name of the product",
         "type": "string"
      },
      "price": {
         "type": "number",
         "minimum": 0,
         "exclusiveMinimum": true
      }
   },
   "required": ["id", "name", "price"]
}

== Architecture Characteristics

=== Performance

* Average Response Times
* Maximum Response Times

=== Scalability

* measure and track average response times across number of users or business requests
* measure and track timeouts across number of users or business requests

=== Elasticity

=== Fault Tolerance

* measure and track number of users impacted by a system or service crash
* measure and track number of requests impacted by a system or service crash

=== Deployability

* measure and track number of actual hours spent to deploy
* measure and track failed deployments or errors resulting from deployment
* measure and track the frequency of deployment

=== Component Coupling

* the extent to which components know about each other

*afferent coupling* - the degree to which other components are dependent on the target component (incomming coupling)

*efferent coupling* - the degree to which the target component is dependent on other components (outgoing coupling)

*temporal coupling* - components are coupled due to non-static or timing dependencies

*external coupling* - multiple components share an externally imposed protocol or data format(e.g. rest)

*control coupling* - one component passes information to another component on what to do

*data coupling* - the degree to which components are bound to a shared data context

=== Component Cohesion
the degree and manner to which the operations of a component are related to one another

=== Metrics

* DIT (depth of inheritance tree)
* WMC (weighted methods/class; sum of CC)
* CE (efferent coupling count)
* CA (afferent coupling count)
* LCOM (Lack of Cohesion in Methods)
