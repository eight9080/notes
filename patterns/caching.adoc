Latency:

* network
* security ( maybe redo checks)
* database

Infinispan - support partial replication

== Cache eviction strategies

* Time to live policy (TTL) +
cache items are evicted based on a timeout parameter

* archive policy (ARC) +
cache items are evicted based on a date from when they were created (not when they were added to the cache)

* Least Frequently Used Policy (LFU) +
cache items are evicted that are accessed the least amount of times

* Least Recently Used Policy (LRU) +
cache items are evicted that havenâ€™t been used recently

* random replacement policy (RR) +
cache items are evicted randomly
