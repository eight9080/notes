== Active Record

Active Record style ORMs map an object to a database row.
One of the benefits of the Active Record style is that you can simple call the save() method on the object to update the database. Each model object inherits from a base Active Record object and so you have access to all the methods relating to persistence.

== Data Mapper

the Data Mapper style completely separates your domain from the persistence layer. This means none of your model objects know anything about the database.
We can’t call the save() method on the object to persist it to the database because it doesn’t exist.
Instead we need to use a completely different service known as an *Entity Manager.
The big benefit of the Data Mapper pattern is, your domain objects don’t need to know anything about how they are stored in the database.
