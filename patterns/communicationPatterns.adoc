= Communication Patterns

== Synchronous Messaging Patterns

The business logic of a given microservice is dependent on one or more other microservices or systems.

=== Request-Response Pattern

* one microservice (which acts as the client) sends a request and waits for a response from one or more other microservices or systems
* The business logic of the client application *blocks* until it receives the response
* the communication channel has *to be kept open* until the response is received by the client application.
* waits until either it receives the response data, or the maximum time that the client intends to wait is reached (which is known as a time-out)
* a query-based interaction.

* Most external-facing services are implemented using this pattern

* select this pattern whenever you need interactive communication among microservices or with external consumers or systems

* *Each service in the chain can introduce a potential performance bottleneck or downtime, which impacts all other services in the chain*.

=== Remote Procedure Calls Pattern

A given microservice can build a certain piece of business logic as a function and make it available for remote invocation by a consumer that resides in a separate process.

* for the client should be similar with making a local procedure call

* The underlying RPC framework handles all the complexities of the remote method invocation over the network and hides the details of the underlying network communication from the application developer.

* as the service developer is to come up with a service definition that outlines the details of the remote methods that you expose to the consumers, service name, name resolution, and data types that the service uses to exchange information
* *interface definition language (IDL)*

* RPC implementations allow you to use the service definition to generate client- and server-side code that handles the low-level protocol details of the RPC communication

* client/server stubs

Steps Client side:

* the client application calls the client stub with the required parameters. This is a *local function call*, as the client stub resides within the client’s process or address space.
*  Then the client stub *serializes* (or marshals) the details of the remote service call into an *encoded binary message*, and the RPC runtime component passes the message to the underlying network transport layer to invoke the remote server application.

Steps Server side:

* the network transport layer passes the call message to the RPC runtime, which invokes the corresponding server stub
* The server stub deserializes (or unmarshals) the binary message and resolves the server procedure, mapping parameters and data types. Then it can call the corresponding server application’s remote procedure, where the server-side business logic resides.
* Once the server’s business logic is executed, it returns the response data types to the server stub, which *marshals it to the reply message*.

* Then the server hands over the message to the RPC runtime, which sends it back to the client application over the network transport layer.

Final client side:

* the client stub unmarshals the return parameters, and execution returns to the client application.

Implementations :

* gRPC - using HTTP2 as the communication protocol and and Protocol Buffers as the data serialization format

RPC-based communication is often suitable for building the *communication among services that are used internally*.

|===

== Asynchronous Messaging Patterns

=== Single-Receiver Pattern

* point-to-point asynchronous messaging

*  a given microservice delivers messages to *exactly one target microservice*, or to a system using a messaging infrastructure such as a message broker.
* The messages sent here are usually considered *commands*

Steps:

* Producer publishes messages to a queue in the message broker
* One consumer service or system then consumes messages from that queue(it ensures the ordered delivery of the messages)
*  The producer service is interested only in whether the message is delivered successfully to the queue

* The message broker offers the required message-delivery guarantees (such as at-least-once delivery)

Implementations:

* *Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)* is the most widely accepted protocol that facilitates queue-based single-consumer messaging

AMQP implementations such as RabbitMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. +
Fully cloud-based messaging solutions such as Microsoft Azure Service Bus.

* end-to-end guaranteed message delivery is required

image:singleReceiver.png[SingleReceiver]

=== Multiple-Receiver Pattern (Publisher-Subscriber)

* messages are delivered to more than one consumer microservice

* One microservice publishes a message to a topic in the event bus, and one or more microservices can subscribe to a given topic.
* The message is asynchronously delivered to all the subscribers of that topic.

* the event bus simply delivers messages to available subscribers
* leverage durable subscription techniques

Implementations:

* event-based multiple-consumer scenarios such as Apache Kafka, Neural Autonomic Transport System (NATS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and Azure Event Grid

* often implemented with support for persistent delivery, which means the events published by the producers are stored in a persistent store

* when the events are published to subscribers, delivery of messages is not guaranteed by default to all
*  this pattern is used when delivery semantics such as at-least-once delivery are not required on the consumer side.

* certain brokers introduce such delivery guarantees with concepts such as *durable topics*: the broker logically persists an instance of each message for every durable consumer, since each durable consumer gets its own copy of the message.

image::multipleReceiver.png[Multiple Receiver]

=== Asynchronous Request-Reply Pattern

* the producer microservice publishes messages to a queue in a message broker, and then the consumer consumes that message from the queue.

* the message contains metadata specifying that it requires a reply, the location where the reply should be sent, and how to correlate the reply.

* The consumer uses that information to send the reply back to the producer via a completely different channel established through a separate queue in the message broker.

|===
|Pattern	|When to use	|When not to use
|Single-Receiver
|One microservice sends an asynchronous command to another microservice. +
For ordered message delivery. +
For guaranteed message delivery. +
|Efficient data transfer is required without delivery semantics such as at-least-once.

|Multiple-Receiver
|More than one consumer is interested in the same message/event.
|Usually not suitable when you need guaranteed message delivery.

|Asynchronous Request-Reply
|For asynchronous messaging scenarios in which correlation is required between a request and a reply.
|Shouldn’t be used as a reliable messaging alternative to synchronous request-response patterns.

== Service Definition Patterns

=== Service Definitions in Synchronous Communication

* publish the service definitions to a central location known as the *service registry*
* metadata repository

* The service definitions that the consumers obtain can be used to build the client application or generate the required client libraries to communicate with the server.

* The service definition contains the interfaces that a given service offers, as well as message formats and schema for data types exchanged between the client and microservices.

Implementations:
Consul, etcd, and Apache ZooKeeper

To define service interfaces:

* RESTful services use OpenAPI
* gRPC uses Protocol Buffers
* GraphQL uses GraphQL schemas

image::SDSync.png[SDSync]

=== Service Definition in Asynchronous Communication

* messages exchanged between producers and consumers contain structured data that is being serialized or deserialized using a schema that defines and validates the data exchanged between the parties.

* a central metadata registry to store the schemas

Steps:

* the producer connects to the schema registry to retrieve the service definition with the schema and validate it
* The consumers follow the same pattern when they deserialize the message so that they read the message based on the schema provided in the registry

* By using schema-based data serialization and deserialization, asynchronous message-based communication can drastically reduce the amount of metadata related to type information and field names that you have to pass along with every message.

Implementations:

* for the schema definition techniques we can use Apache Avro, Protocol Buffers, or JSON schemas.

* Kafka supports Avro
* Azure uses Azure Schema Registry

For applications that use event-driven architecture, the service definitions can leverage event-describing specifications, such as CloudEvents.

image::SDAsync.png[SD Async]

==== Schema definitions with Kafka Schema Registry
*Kafka Schema Registry* - can store and retrieve your schema definitions for messages exchanged between producers and consumers in asynchronous messaging

* can store Avro, JSON, and Protocol Buffers schemas
* stores a versioned history of all schemas and provides serializers that plug into Kafka clients.
* These clients handle schema storage and retrieval for Kafka messages that are sent in any of the supported formats.

Cloud messaging services such as Amazon Kinesis and Azure Event Hubs also support this pattern

==== Service definitions with AsyncAPI
AsyncAPI can be used to specify the entire service contract rather than just the schema for the messages.

Schema registries provide only the schema for messages exchanged between producers and consumers. However, these registries don’t specify any contract details related to publishing or consuming messages. AsyncAPI tries to standardize the definition of the service contracts for producers and consumers in asynchronous messaging.

=== Technologies to Implement Synchronous Messaging Patterns

==== RESTful Services

The REST model uses a navigational scheme to represent objects and services over a network. These are known as resources—objects with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on them

==== GraphQL

GraphQL is based on the concept of sending a query as a request to the microservice.

GraphQL allows clients to determine which data they want, how they want it, and in what format.

GraphQL primarily uses *queries, mutations, and subscriptions* as the main interaction styles with consumers and services. With a query, the client can request the data it needs from the server, while mutations are mostly used to modify data on the server

GraphQL is commonly used for external-facing microservices or APIs that are directly exposed to consumers (clients such as mobile applications)

GraphQL offers an efficient way to fetch data without over-fetching (retrieving redundant data not required for the consumer) or under-fetching (retrieving only a portion of required data, which results in subsequent requests to fetch the remaining data).

With GraphQL, the consumer can fetch the exact data needed in a single request. GraphQL provides other advantages including validation and type checking, detailed error handling, and *backward-compatible versioning*.

==== WebSocket

* TCP over the web
* supports full duplex (allows communication in both directions)
* asynchronous messaging once the connection is established
* uses a single TCP connection for traffic in both directions and uses HTTP as the initial handshaking protocol

* WebSocket doesn’t mandate a specific data serialization format for messages

image::websocket.png[WebSocket]

==== gRPC

* uses an efficient binary data serialization format, Protocol Buffers, to marshal and unmarshal data exchanged between the client and server applications

* is implemented on top of HTTP2

The underlying gRPC framework handles all the complexities normally associated with enforcing strict service contracts, data serialization, network communication, authentication, access control, and observability.

*Apache Thrift*, another RPC framework similar to gRPC, uses its own interface definition language and offers support for a wide range of programming languages.

|===
|Synchronous messaging technology	|When to use
|RESTful services
|The business use case fits the resource-oriented model +
The service needs to interoperate with disparate sets of clients (web clients, mobile clients). +
The service needs to negotiate to support various content types (JSON, CSV, XML) based on client requests. +
You need human-readable text-based message formats. +

|GraphQL
|Clients want to determine the data they want, how they want it, and the data format.
|You want a well-defined yet flexible schema for interservice communication.
|You want to reduce the number of service calls needed to retrieve business data from a service.

|gRPC
|Require low-latency and high-throughput interservice communication. +
Type-safe and robust data exchange between microservices. +
The client or the server application needs to build a streaming business operation.

|WebSocket
|You have to implement full-duplex efficient messaging between services using your own data formats.

=== Technologies to Implement Asynchronous Messaging Patterns

==== AMQP - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

*  ensures rapid and reliable message delivery, and message acknowledgments

* When a *producer* delivers a message to a queue, *the broker sends acknowledgments*, and when a message is delivered to a consumer,
* the *consumer notifies the broker*, either automatically or when the application code decides to do so.

* In message acknowledgments mode, the broker will completely *remove a message* from a queue only when it receives a notification for that message (or group of messages).

==== Kafka

*  distributed open source event bus/broker solution built on the concept of maintaining messages/events as a *distributed commit log*

* The messages in Kafka are stored durably, in order, and can be read deterministically by multiple consumers at their own speed.

* As Kafka does not remove the events from the log upon delivery, it enables the replay of events. It uses an event sequence number to enable consumers to track their position in the stream to allow for selective replay

==== NATS

*  a simple, open source messaging infrastructure specifically built for cloud native applications
* facilitates message-delivery semantics such as at-most-once and at-least-once
* uses logs for storing events, uses event sequence numbers to track events, and provides the ability to replay.
