== Anti-Corruption Layer pattern

Implement a fa√ßade or adapter layer between different subsystems that don't share the same semantics.

Maintaining access between new and legacy systems can force the new system to adhere to at least some of the legacy system's APIs or other semantics. When these legacy features have quality issues, supporting them "corrupts" what might otherwise be a cleanly designed modern application.

Isolate the different subsystems by placing an anti-corruption layer between them. This layer translates communications between the two systems, allowing one system to remain unchanged while the other can avoid compromising its design and technological approach.

The anti-corruption layer contains all of the logic necessary to translate between the two systems. The layer can be implemented as a component within the application or as an independent service.

=== Issues and considerations

* The anti-corruption layer may add latency to calls made between the two systems.
* The anti-corruption layer adds an additional service that must be managed and maintained.
* Consider how your anti-corruption layer will scale.
* Consider whether you need more than one anti-corruption layer. You may want to decompose functionality into multiple services using different technologies or languages, or there may be other reasons to partition the anti-corruption layer.
* Consider how the anti-corruption layer will be managed in relation with your other applications or services. How will it be integrated into your monitoring, release, and configuration processes?
* Make sure transaction and data consistency are maintained and can be monitored.
* Consider whether the anti-corruption layer needs to handle all communication between different subsystems, or just a subset of features.
* If the anti-corruption layer is part of an application migration strategy, consider whether it will be permanent, or will be retired after all legacy functionality has been migrated.
