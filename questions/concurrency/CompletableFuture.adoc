= CompletableFuture

The Future interface was added in Java 5 to serve as a result of an asynchronous computation, but it did not have any methods to combine these computations or handle possible errors.

Java 8 introduced the CompletableFuture class.

* it implements the Future interface and the *CompletionStage* interface.

* contains 50 different methods for composing, combining, and executing asynchronous computation steps and handling errors

Example

A method that creates a CompletableFuture instance, then spins off some computation in another thread and returns the Future immediately.

----
public Future<String> calculateAsync() throws InterruptedException {
    CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = new CompletableFuture<>();

    Executors.newCachedThreadPool().submit(() -> {
        Thread.sleep(500);
        completableFuture.complete("Hello");
        return null;
    });

    return completableFuture;
}
----

The Future instance -> call the get method on it when we're ready to block for the result.

The get method throws some checked exceptions:

* ExecutionException (encapsulating an exception that occurred during a computation)
* InterruptedException (an exception signifying that a thread executing a method was interrupted)

----
Future<String> completableFuture = calculateAsync();

// ...

String result = completableFuture.get();
assertEquals("Hello", result);
----

== CompletableFuture with Encapsulated Computation Logic

Static methods `runAsync` and `supplyAsync` allow us to create a CompletableFuture instance out of Runnable and Supplier functional types correspondingly.

----
CompletableFuture<String> future
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
// ...
assertEquals("Hello", future.get());
----

=== Processing Results of Asynchronous Computations

The `thenApply` method accepts a Function instance, uses it to process the result, and returns a Future that holds a value returned by a function

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");

CompletableFuture<String> future = completableFuture
  .thenApply(s -> s + " World");

assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());
----

The thenAccept method receives a Consumer and passes it the result of the computation. Then the final future.get() call returns an instance of the Void type

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");

CompletableFuture<Void> future = completableFuture
  .thenAccept(s -> System.out.println("Computation returned: " + s));

future.get();
----

If we neither need the value of the computation, nor want to return some value at the end of the chain, then we can pass a Runnable lambda to the thenRun method

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");

CompletableFuture<Void> future = completableFuture
  .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Computation finished."));

future.get();
----

=== Combining Futures

The ability to combine CompletableFuture instances in a chain of computation steps -> monadic design pattern.

The `thenCompose` method to chain two Futures sequentially

This method takes a function that returns a CompletableFuture instance. The argument of this function is the result of the previous computation step. This allows us to use this value inside the next CompletableFuture‘s lambda:

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
    .thenCompose(s -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> s + " World"));

assertEquals("Hello World", completableFuture.get());
----

The thenCompose (flatMap) method receives a function that returns another object of the same type

To execute two independent Futures and do something with their results -> `thenCombine` method that accepts a Future and a Function with two arguments to process both results:

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
    .thenCombine(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> " World"), (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2));

assertEquals("Hello World", completableFuture.get());
----

To do something with two Futures‘ results, but don't need to pass any resulting value down a Future chain -> The `thenAcceptBoth` method

----
CompletableFuture future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
  .thenAcceptBoth(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> " World"),
    (s1, s2) -> System.out.println(s1 + s2));
----

=== Running Multiple Futures in Parallel

The CompletableFuture.allOf static method allows to wait for completion of all of the Futures provided as a var-arg:
----
CompletableFuture<String> future1
= CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
CompletableFuture<String> future2
= CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Beautiful");
CompletableFuture<String> future3
= CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "World");

CompletableFuture<Void> combinedFuture
= CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2, future3);

// ...

combinedFuture.get();

assertTrue(future1.isDone());
assertTrue(future2.isDone());
assertTrue(future3.isDone());
----

The return type of the CompletableFuture.allOf() is a CompletableFuture<Void>.
The limitation of this method is that it does not return the combined results of all Futures.
Instead, we have to manually get results from Futures.
`CompletableFuture.join()` method and Java 8 Streams API makes it simple:

----
String combined = Stream.of(future1, future2, future3)
.map(CompletableFuture::join)
.collect(Collectors.joining(" "));

assertEquals("Hello Beautiful World", combined);
----

=== Handling Errors

The CompletableFuture class allows us to handle it in a special handle method.
This method receives two parameters: a result of a computation (if it finished successfully), and the exception thrown (if some computation step did not complete normally).

----
String name = null;

// ...

CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  =  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
      if (name == null) {
          throw new RuntimeException("Computation error!");
      }
      return "Hello, " + name;
  })}).handle((s, t) -> s != null ? s : "Hello, Stranger!");

assertEquals("Hello, Stranger!", completableFuture.get());
----

To manually complete the Future with a value, as in the first example, but also have the ability to complete it with an exception.
The completeExceptionally method is intended for just that. The completableFuture.get() method in the following example throws an ExecutionException with a RuntimeException as its cause:

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = new CompletableFuture<>();

// ...

completableFuture.completeExceptionally(
new RuntimeException("Calculation failed!"));

// ...

completableFuture.get(); // ExecutionException
----

=== Async Methods

Methods with the Async postfix are usually intended for running a corresponding step of execution in another thread.

The methods without the Async postfix run the next execution stage using a calling thread.

the Async method without the Executor argument runs a step using the common fork/join pool implementation of Executor that is accessed with the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() method.

The Async method with an Executor argument runs a step using the passed Executor.

----
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");

CompletableFuture<String> future = completableFuture.thenApplyAsync(s -> s + " World");

assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());
----

=== JDK 9 CompletableFuture API
Java 9 enhances the CompletableFuture API with the following changes:

* New factory methods added
* Support for delays and timeouts
* Improved support for subclassing and new instance APIs:
----
Executor defaultExecutor()
CompletableFuture<U> newIncompleteFuture()
CompletableFuture<T> copy()
CompletionStage<T> minimalCompletionStage()
CompletableFuture<T> completeAsync(Supplier<? extends T> supplier, Executor executor)
CompletableFuture<T> completeAsync(Supplier<? extends T> supplier)
CompletableFuture<T> orTimeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
CompletableFuture<T> completeOnTimeout(T value, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
----

Static utility methods:

----
Executor delayedExecutor(long delay, TimeUnit unit, Executor executor)
Executor delayedExecutor(long delay, TimeUnit unit)
<U> CompletionStage<U> completedStage(U value)
<U> CompletionStage<U> failedStage(Throwable ex)
<U> CompletableFuture<U> failedFuture(Throwable ex)
----

To address timeout, Java 9 has introduced two more new functions:
----
orTimeout()
completeOnTimeout()
----
