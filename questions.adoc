What is Autoboxing/unboxing?

Autoboxing is automatic casting of variables of primitive types to corresponding wrapper class. Unboxing is the inverted cast.
Useful to reduce the amount of code to be written. Pitfalls: can be unintentionally slow if used in a loop. Also care has to be taken with cached values. (e.g. a pool of Integers from -128 to +127)

What is a FunctionalInterface? - what conditions are needed for a interface to be functional interface?
A functional interface is an interface with no more, no less but one single abstract method (default methods do not count).
Where an instance of such interface is required, a Lambda Expression can be used instead. More formally put: Functional interfaces provide target types for lambda expressions and method references.

Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface, and its implementation may be treated as lambda expressions.

Can you give some example of functional interfaces Function Consumer Supplier Predicate - functional interfaces in the java.util.function package
- Function – it takes one argument and returns a result
- Consumer – it takes one argument and returns no result (represents a side effect)
- Supplier – it takes not argument and returns a result
- Predicate – it takes one argument and returns a boolean
- BiFunction – it takes two arguments and returns a result
- BinaryOperator – it is similar to a BiFunction, taking two arguments and returning a result. The two arguments and the result are all of the same types
- UnaryOperator – it is similar to a Function, taking a single argument and returning a result of the same type

What is a Lambda expression and what it is used for. 
a lambda expression is a function that can be referenced and passed around as an object.
Lambda expressions introduce functional style processing in Java and facilitate the writing of compact and easy-to-read code.
Because of this, lambda expressions are a natural replacement for anonymous classes as method arguments. One of their main uses is to define inline implementations of functional interfaces.



What is a default method why were needed/introduced?
A default method is a method with an implementation – which can be found in an interface.
We can use a default method to add a new functionality to an interface while maintaining backward compatibility with classes that are already implementing the interface


How hashset is implemented in Java internally.
Difference between a stream and a collection
 a stream is an iterator whose role is to accept a set of actions to apply on each of the elements it contains.
The stream represents a sequence of objects from a source such as a collection, which supports aggregate operations. They were designed to make collection processing simple and concise. Contrary to the collections, the logic of iteration is implemented inside the stream, so we can use methods like map and flatMap for performing a declarative processing.

What Is the Difference Between Intermediate and Terminal Operations?

Stream operations are combined into pipelines to process streams. All operations are either intermediate or terminal.
Intermediate operations are those operations that return Stream itself allowing for further operations on a stream.
These operations are always lazy, i.e. they do not process the stream at the call site, an intermediate operation can only process data when there is a terminal operation. Some of the intermediate operations are filter, map and flatMap.
Terminal operations terminate the pipeline and initiate stream processing. The stream is passed through all intermediate operations during terminal operation call. Terminal operations include forEach, reduce, Collect and sum.

Java 8 Date and Time API

The existing classes such as java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormatter aren’t thread-safe, leading to potential concurrency issues for users.

difference between a tread and a process
why methods wait notify and notify all are in object class and not in thread class
wait and notify methods are associated with locks which is owned by object not thread, and that's why it make sense to keep those method on java.lang.Object class.

Java Collections
The basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework
Java Collections Framework provides a well designed set of interfaces and classes that support operations on a collections of objects. The most basic interfaces that reside in the Java Collections Framework are:
Collection, which represents a group of objects known as its elements.
Set, which is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
List, which is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements.
Map, which is an object that maps keys to values and cannot contain duplicate keys.

interface Iterable
    interface Collection extends Iterable
    interfaces List, Queue, Set extend Collection
    interface SortedSet extends Set
    interface Map
    interface SortedMap extends Map
    classes ArrayList, Vector, Stack, LinkedList implement List
    classes HashSet, LinkedHashSet implement Set
    class TreeSet implements SortedSet
    classes HashMap, WeakHashMap, LinkedHashMap implement Map
    class TreeMap implements SortedMap
    utility classes Collections and Arrays

Differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ? The differences of these elements are listed below:
An Iterator can be used to traverse the Set and List collections, while the ListIterator can be used to iterate only over Lists.
The Iterator can traverse a collection only in forward direction, while the ListIterator can traverse a List in both directions.
The ListIterator implements the Iterator interface and contains extra functionality, such as adding an element, replacing an element, getting the index position for previous and next elements, etc.

Difference between fail-fast and fail-safe ? 
The Iterator's fail-safe property works with the clone of the underlying collection and thus, it is not affected by any modification in the collection. All the collection classes in java.util package are fail-fast, while the collection classes in java.util.concurrent are fail-safe. Fail-fast iterators throw a ConcurrentModificationException, while fail-safe iterator never throws such an exception.

How HashMap works in Java ? 
A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs. The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the HashMap calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a HashMapare its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing.

 What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods ? In Java, a HashMap uses the hashCode and equals methods to determine the index of the key-value pair and to detect duplicates. More specifically, the hashCodemethod is used in order to determine where the specified key will be stored. Since different keys may produce the same hash value, the equals method is used, in order to determine whether the specified key actually exists in the collection or not.

What is Java Priority Queue ? The PriorityQueue is an unbounded queue, based on a priority heap and its elements are ordered in their natural order. At the time of its creation, we can provide a Comparator that is responsible for ordering the elements of the PriorityQueue. A PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null values, those objects that doesn’t provide natural ordering, or those objects that don’t have any comparator associated with them. Finally, the Java PriorityQueue is not thread-safe and it requires O(log(n)) time for its enqueing and dequeing operations.

The difference between HashSet and TreeSet ? The HashSet is Implemented using a hash table and thus, its elements are not ordered. The add, remove, and contains methods of a HashSet have constant time complexity O(1). On the other hand, a TreeSet is implemented using a tree structure. The elements in a TreeSet are sorted, and thus, the add, remove, and contains methods have time complexity of O(logn).

2. What is HashMap and Map?

    Map is an interface. Contains methods to manipulate Key-Value based collections. The main methods of Map interface are put(K,V), get(K), Collection<V> values(), Set<K> keySet(), containsKey(), containsValue()
    HashMap is one of implementations of the Map interface based on hashcodes of objects used as keys.

3. Difference between HashMap and HashTable? Can we make hashmap synchronized?

    Both implement Map interface. HashTable is synchronized. It is recommended to use HashMap wherever possible. HashTable doesn't allow null keys and values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.
    We can make it synchronized
        Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap());

6. List vs Set vs Map. Purposes and definitions.

    All three are interfaces.

    List -- storing values in specified order. Provides methods to get the element by its position get(i), finding element, ListIterator. 
	Known implementations: ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList. List should be used when the order in which the elements are stored matters.

    Set -- storing only different objects and at most one null element. Known implementations: TreeSet (iterate over the elements in order defined by Comparator, or if the elements implement comparable; 
		provides log(n) performance for basic operations), 
		HashSet -- stores values in buckets defined by their hashcodes. Each bucket is a singly linked list. Provides constant time performance for basic operations. LinkedHashSet

    Map -- for storing key-value pairs. Map cannot contain duplicate keys. 
Provides three collection views: set of keys, collection of values, set of key-value mappings. 
Know implementations HashMap, EnumMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, WeakHashMap.

7. Pros and cons of ArrayList and LinkedList

    ArrayList -- fast random access.
    LinkedList -- slow random access. Implements Queue interface. Fast deletion of the element.
    If lots of random reads is anticipated use ArrayList.
    If lots of iterations over the whole list and lots of add/delete -- use LinkedList.

8. TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

    LinkedHashSet is backed by LinkedHashMap. LinkedHashMap is backed by doubly linked list to enforce ordering on the elements contained in the Map.
    If the ordering of the elements in the Set matters to you but you don't want to use a comparator you may use LinkedHashSet since it will enforce ordering in which the elements were added to the set.
    Otherwise use TreeSet

9. Differences between Hashtable, ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap()

    ConcurrentHashMap allows concurrent modification of the Map from several threads without the need to block them. 
Collections.synchronizedMap(map) creates a blocking Map which will degrade performance, albeit ensure consistency (if used properly).
    Use the second option if you need to ensure data consistency, and each thread needs to have an up-to-date view of the map. 
Use the first if performance is critical, and each thread only inserts data to the map, with reads happening less frequently.

26. What method should the key class of Hashmap override?

    equals() and hashCode().

13. How are hash codes computed?

    if hashCode() method is defined then it is called to calculate the hashcode
    if its not defined the default implementation in Object class does the following:

        public int hashCode() {
            return VMMemoryManager.getIdentityHashCode(this);
        }

14. Is it possible that hash code is not unique?

    It's totally possible. Actually a totally valid hashCode() function could look like this

    int hashCode(){ return 57; }

15. Can we put two elements with equal hash code to one hash map?

    Yes we can. The hashcode of objects doesn't matter. Only the hashcode of keys. But even if you want to put keys with the same hashcode it will be ok since it just means that key-value pairs will be put into the same bucket

16. Iterator and modification of a List. ConcurentModificationException.

    The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. 
Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.

    Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.

17. What is the significance of ListIterator? What is the difference b/w Iterator and ListIterator?

    ListIterator allows to perform iteration both ways (first-->last and last-->first)
    From JavaDoc: ListIterator is an iterator for lists that allows the programmer to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's current position in the list

Q #4) What is “SQL Injection”?

Answer: SQL Injection is one of the common attacking techniques used by hackers to get critical data.

Hackers check for any loophole in the system through which they can pass SQL queries, bypass the security checks, and return back the critical data. This is known as SQL injection. It can allow hackers to steal critical data or even crash a system.

SQL injections are very critical and need to be avoided. Periodic security testing can prevent this kind of attack. SQL database security needs to be defined correctly and input boxes and special characters should be handled properly.

Resilience

Q #6) What is XSS or Cross-Site Scripting?

Answer: XSS or cross-site scripting is a type of vulnerability that hackers used to attack web applications.

It allows hackers to inject HTML or JAVASCRIPT code into a web page that can steal the confidential information from the cookies and returns to the hackers. It is one of the most critical and common techniques which needs to be prevented.

Q #7) What are the SSL connections and an SSL session?

Answer: SSL or Secured Socket Layer connection is a transient peer-to-peer communications link where each connection is associated with one SSL Session.

SSL session can be defined as an association between client and server generally created by the handshake protocol. There are a set of parameters defined and it may be shared by multiple SSL connections.
