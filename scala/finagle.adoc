= Finagle

Twitter's RPC library

== Building blocks

=== Services

Services: - functions represented by classes

* IN: take requests
* OUT: return a Future containing the eventual result of the operation or information about the failure.

=== Filters

*Filters are also functions.*

* IN: take a request and a service
* do some operations on the request, pass it to the service
* do some operations on the resulting Future
* finally return the final Future.

*Aspects* as they can implement logic that happens around the execution of a function and alter its input and output.

=== Futures

Futures - the eventual results of the asynchronous operations.

States:

* pending
* succeeded
* failed

== Example simple implementation

=== Service

Create a class that will extend the abstract Service class from the Finagle library, implementing its *apply method*.

[source, java]
----
public class GreetingService extends Service<Request, Response> {
    @Override
    public Future<Response> apply(Request request) {
        String greeting = "Hello " + request.getParam("name");
        Reader<Buf> reader = Reader.fromBuf(new Buf.ByteArray(greeting.getBytes(), 0, greeting.length()));
        return Future.value(Response.apply(request.version(), Status.Ok(), reader));
    }
}
----

=== Filter

* a filter that will log some data about the request to the console

* implement Filterâ€˜s apply method that'll take request and return a Future response

The basic *Filter* class has four type-parameters.
The *SimpleFilter* that merges the four type-parameters into two
[source, java]
----
public class LogFilter extends SimpleFilter<Request, Response> {
    @Override
    public Future apply(Request request, Service<Request, Response> service) {
        logger.info("Request host:" + request.host().getOrElse(() -> ""));
        logger.info("Request params:");
        request.getParams().forEach(entry -> logger.info("\t" + entry.getKey() + " : " + entry.getValue()));
        return service.apply(request);
    }
}
----

=== Server

* use the service and the filter to build a server that will actually listen for requests and process them.

----
Service serverService = new LogFilter().andThen(new GreetingService());
Http.serve(":8080", serverService);
----

=== Client

* create an HTTP service using the convenient newService method from Finagle's Http class. It'll be directly responsible for sending the request.

That last operation is *asynchronous* and its eventual results are stored in the Future instance. We could wait for this Future to succeed or fail but that would be a blocking operation and we may want to avoid it. Instead, we can implement a callback to be triggered when the Future succeeds:

----
Service<Request, Response> clientService = new LogFilter().andThen(Http.newService(":8080"));
Request request = Request.apply(Method.Get(), "/?name=John");
request.host("localhost");
Future<Response> response = clientService.apply(request);

Await.result(response
        .onSuccess(r -> {
            assertEquals("Hello John", r.getContentString());
            return BoxedUnit.UNIT;
        })
        .onFailure(r -> {
            throw new RuntimeException(r);
        })
);
