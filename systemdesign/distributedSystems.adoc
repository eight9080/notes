= Distributed Systems

== Scaling

* vertical - add more hardware in a single machine
** limited vertical scalability
** single point of failure
** highly latency
** security and privacy

* horizontal

== Concepts

*Node* - a process running on a dedicated machine

*Cluster* - a collection of nodes

*Apache Zookeeper* - a high performance coordination service designed specifically for distributed systems.

Each element in a tree - ZNode - store data and have children

Types of Znodes:

* persistent - persists between sessions
* ephemeral - is deleted when the session ends

Leader Election Algorithm

* each node candidates
* each node has an order
* the smallest order -> leader

=== Zookeeper

Start `./zkServer.sh start`

Cli `ZkCli.sh`

List `ls /`

Create a node `create /parent "some parent data"`

Create a child node `create /parent/child "some child data"`

List children `ls /parent`

Info of node `get /parent`

Remove node `rmr /parent`

Create Election

```
create /election ""
ls /
get /election
```

==== Zookeeper Threading Model

* App start code in the main method is executed on the *main thread*
* When Zookeeper object is created, two additional threads are created
 ** Event Thread
   *** manages events
     **** Connection (KeeperState.SyncConnected)
     **** DisConnection (KeeperState.Disconnected)
   *** custom znode Watchers and triggers we subscribe to
   *** events are executed on the Event Thread - in the order they arrived
** IO Thread
   *** handles network communication with Zookeeper servers
   *** handles Zookeeper requests and responses
   *** response to pings
   *** session management and session timeouts

==== Watcher and triggers
* we can register a watcher when we call the methods
 ** `getChildren`, `getData`, `exists`
* the watcher allows to get a notification when a change happens
