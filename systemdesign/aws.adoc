== Availability zone - AZ

An AZ consists of one to six data centers, with redundant power supplies and networking connectivity.
A single data center can be part of only one AZ. Each AZ is located in a different floodplain; power grids are designed in such a way that a natural calamity or disaster does not impact multiple AZs

The networking among the AZs in a particular region is designed in such a way that it offers inexpensive, low-latency, private, fiber-optic network connectivity to another AZ in the same region. The latency between the AZs within a region is less than a single digit.

AWS offers edge locations, or points of presence (POPs), to provide a better user experience to customers

AWS has recently added regional edge cache locations between the main servers and the edge locations. When an object is not accessed for a long time, it goes out of the cache, but because the regional edge cache maintains a larger cache, the object can be stored there for a longer amount of time. If an application accesses the object again, it does not have to go to the main server for the access. When the application is not able to find the object in the edge location, it looks for the file in the regional edge cache.

== AWS Security and Compliance

*shared security*:

* AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud
* customers are responsible for the security in the cloud.

AWS is responsible for the physical security of the data centers.

Customers are responsible for securing the application, the data being hosted.

A managed service (for example, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, and so on), AWS is also responsible for the security configuration of it.

== AWS Products and Services

=== Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

EC2 - includes the virtual servers, called instances

=== Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps in automatically scaling the Amazon EC2 instances up and down as per the policies you define.

If for some reason an instance goes down, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling quickly spins up a new instance.

=== AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda enables you to run code without provisioning or managing any servers or infrastructure. You can run any code for any kind of application or back-end service. You simply develop code for your application or back-end service and define the event triggers with the AWS Lambda service.

=== Amazon EC2 Container Service

ECS -  allows you to run Docker containers on Amazon EC2 instances.

=== Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

Amazon EKS - is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run your code on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes

=== AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS

=== AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk lets you run and manage web applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

=== Amazon Lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is the simplest way to get started with AWS for small businesses, developers, students

=== AWS Batch

AWS Batch enables users to efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS

=== AWS Outposts

AWS Outposts help in extending AWS services to any data center.

== Networking

=== Amazon Virtual Private Cloud

* your own data center in the cloud.
* have complete control over the networking in an Amazon VPC.
* can bring your own IP addresses, can define the subnets as you want, and have full control over the route table and network gateways.

=== Amazon Route 53

* Domain Name System (DNS) web service
* highly available and scalable, and its SLA is 100 percent uptime
* IPv4 and IPv6 compliant
* manage failover from primary to secondary hosted applications

=== Elastic Load Balancing

* automatically distribute the load across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
* supports load balancing of HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP traffic to Amazon EC2 instances.
* can be integrated with Auto Scaling
* can automatically scale up and down your Amazon EC2 instance and dynamically grow and shrink your operation depending on the traffic
* ELB helps you to achieve fault tolerance for your applications

=== AWS Direct Connect

* establish private, dedicated network connectivity from your data center to AWS.
* AWS Direct Connect can be used from either your data center or your office or colocation.
* can reduce bandwidth costs for high-volume data transfers and get consistent network performance.

=== AWS App Mesh

* helps monitor, control, debug, and trace communications between services
* can be used with services running on EC2 as well as with microservice containers

=== AWS Global Accelerator

* improves the availability and performance of your applications for global users.
* provides a set of static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network, which provides a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminates the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS regions and AZs.
