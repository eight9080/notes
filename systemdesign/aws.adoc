== Availability zone - AZ

An AZ consists of one to six data centers, with redundant power supplies and networking connectivity.
A single data center can be part of only one AZ. Each AZ is located in a different floodplain; power grids are designed in such a way that a natural calamity or disaster does not impact multiple AZs

The networking among the AZs in a particular region is designed in such a way that it offers inexpensive, low-latency, private, fiber-optic network connectivity to another AZ in the same region. The latency between the AZs within a region is less than a single digit.

AWS offers edge locations, or points of presence (POPs), to provide a better user experience to customers

AWS has recently added regional edge cache locations between the main servers and the edge locations. When an object is not accessed for a long time, it goes out of the cache, but because the regional edge cache maintains a larger cache, the object can be stored there for a longer amount of time. If an application accesses the object again, it does not have to go to the main server for the access. When the application is not able to find the object in the edge location, it looks for the file in the regional edge cache.

== AWS Security and Compliance

*shared security*:

* AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud
* customers are responsible for the security in the cloud.

AWS is responsible for the physical security of the data centers.

Customers are responsible for securing the application, the data being hosted.

A managed service (for example, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, and so on), AWS is also responsible for the security configuration of it.
