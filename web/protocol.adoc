= Protocol

== HTTP 2

* *Binary protocol*: Less readable by humans but more machine friendly, the HTTP/2 framing layer is a binary framed protocol.
* *Multiplexing*: This refers to interwoven requests and responses. _Multiple requests run at the same time on the same connection_.
* *Server push*: The server can decide to send additional resources to the client.
* *Single connection to server*: HTTP/2 uses a single communication line (TCP connection) per origin (domain).
* *Header compression*: HTTP/2 relies on HPACK compression to reduce headers. This has a significant impact on redundant bytes.
* *Encrypted*: Most of the data that's transferred over the wires is encrypted.
