= Cryptography

== Purpose
- Nonrepudiation - can't claim it was not send by you
- Integrity - is the data you sent
- Authentication
- Confidentiality

=== Process
Plaintext + Encryption = Chiphertext
Chipertext + Descryption = Plaintext

== Types of Cryptography
=== Symmetric
Pro

- both parties use the same key
- super fast
- easy to implement
- key isn't transmitted with data

Not good

- key has to be distributed to all parties
- manageability
- look out for Dictionary Attacks
- hard to prove authenticity

=== Asymmetric
Pro

- two keys required (public and private)
- digital signature
- better security

Not good

- slower and more CPU power
- not good id the private key is exposed
- MiTM and Brute force attacks
- No decryption if the private key is lost

Government Access to Key (GAK)

== Ciphers

Types: Classical and Modern

Classical: Substitution, Transposition

Modern: Symmetric, Asymmetric, Block, Stream

Algorithms:

DES Data Encryption Standard
64-bit blocks, 56-bit key for encryption/decryption

3DES - 3 des with 3 keys (K1, K2, K3)

AES - Advanced Encryption Standard - symmetric key algorithm
128-bit blocks , 128/192/256 bit keys
- encrypting data that is not classified

RC4 - variable key size, symmetric
- not that good, was used part of wep


== Standards and Protocols
