= Cryptography

== Purpose
- Nonrepudiation - can't claim it was not send by you
- Integrity - is the data you sent
- Authentication
- Confidentiality

=== Process
Plaintext + Encryption = Chiphertext
Chipertext + Descryption = Plaintext

Entropy - how random is a number

- One-time Pad
Truly random, used only once, maximum entropy +
hard to use

Diffie Hellman -  is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel
Large primes - 2048 bits +
Man in the Middle attack

== Types of Cryptography
=== Symmetric
Pro

- both parties use the same key
- super fast
- easy to implement
- key isn't transmitted with data

Not good

- key has to be distributed to all parties
- manageability
- look out for Dictionary Attacks
- hard to prove authenticity

=== Asymmetric
Pro

- two keys required (public and private)
- digital signature
- better security
- private key - proves your identity
- public key - sends you encrypted data

Not good

- slower and more CPU power
- not good id the private key is exposed
- MiTM and Brute force attacks
- No decryption if the private key is lost

Government Access to Key (GAK)

== Ciphers

Block ciphers - divides message into blocks (same size) - encrypts each block individual. +
Whereas confusion serves to hide the key, diffusion serves to hide patterns within the original message.

=== Initialization vector
to initialize the cipher block chain with a *random* vector each time we encrypt a message. +
This initialization vector is the *same size as our block size* and gives us a random starting point for our cipher block chaining.


Types: Classical and Modern

Classical: Substitution, Transposition

Modern: Symmetric, Asymmetric, Block, Stream

Algorithms:

DES - Data Encryption Standard
64-bit blocks, 56-bit key for encryption/decryption


3DES - 3 des with 3 keys (K1, K2, K3)

==== AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
AES - Advanced Encryption Standard - symmetric key algorithm
128-bit(16 bytes) blocks , 128/192/256 bit keys
- encrypting data that is not classified +
Rounds include key expansion, XORing the round key, substitution, shifting rows, and mixing columns. +

AES with Electronic Code Book - week block cypher mode
AES with Cypher Block Chaining - improvement

RC4 - variable key size, symmetric
- not that good, was used part of wep

Blowfish - symmetric block
- same key to encrypt/decrypt
- 64-bit blocks, 32-448 bit key
- advantage - speed

Twofish - 128-bit block
- 256-bit key
- single key

Compression and Error Correction


== Standards and Protocols

DSA - 320-bit for signatures/512-1024 bit for security/ Private-Public keys

RSA - Uses two large prime numbers

Deffie-Hellman - Allows two parties to form a shared key over a public network

== Hashes
- check a document was not changed
- a document receives a digital signature
- Message Digest - MD - 128-bit hash value (foundation MD2, MD4,MD5)
- SHA-1 - Secure Hash Algorithm - takes the input -> 160-bit -> hex, used with PGP, TLS, SSH, SSL
- SHA-2 - similar tu SHA1-1, stronger
- SHA-3 - sponge construction, XORed

Tool: Sysinternals

=== Designed for Messages
HMAC - embedded hash function
CHAP - PPP, 3-way handshake
EAP - Passwords, One-Time passwords(OTP), ID cards, Smart Tokens

Encrypt a message with a public key of the receiver.
Receiver uses the private key to decrypt the email and read it.

CA - issues digital certificates - trusted 3rd party
Verisign, thawte, Entrust, GoDady, DigiCert
- issues, revoking, distributes certificates

Certificate - identifying a user/org, public key, alg, issuer, subject name

Signed certificate - signed by a public CA, private key is kept secret by the CA
Self-signed certificate - signed by the same org

== Encrypting Emails, File and Disk drives

== Java Cryptography Extensions JCE
*KeyGenerator* generates *SecretKeys* +
SecretKeys are used for symmetric encryption algorithms like AES.

On the asymmetric side -> *KeyPairGenerator* gives a *PublicKey and a PrivateKey*.

Also at this generative level we have *SecureRandom* - a cryptographically strong random number generator and *IvParameterSpec* - an initialization vector for block ciphers. +
The keys in the initialization vectors go into creating *Cipher* and *Signature* classes - perform the work of the symmetric or asymmetric encryption and signatures +
CipherInputStream and CipherOutputStream -  Java input and output stream pipeline in order to pass an entire message through a block cipher.

=== Digital Signatures
Verify an email was send by the real person.
The email is signed with the private key of the sender,
and is verified with the public key of the sender by the receiver.

Confidentiality.
- encrypt a message and then send the secret key that we used to encrypt the message to just the person that we want to be able to read it.
- encrypt symmetric key with public key
- confidence that only recipient can read it

Authenticity
- guarantee that the message came from a particular source.
- to take a digest of the original message.
- *A digest* is simply a *hash*, a smaller number computed from the larger message.
- Using our private key, we can encrypt the digest, which digitally signs the original message.
- The recipient can compute the same digest using the hash function and then decrypt our signature using our public key.
- If the two match, then the signature is valid. So in order for this to work, we have to choose an *appropriate hashing function*.

- CRC-32* - CRC is Cyclic Redundancy Check
- 32 means that this hash produces a 32 bit number.
- CRC-32 is a polynomial on 33 bits, but only 32 bits of the result are stored.
- this polynomial is easily reversible.

==== Hashing Algorithms
Both the SHA-2 and the SHA-3 family are considered cryptographically secure.


=== SSL Secure Sockets Layer/ TLS Transport Layer Security
- private channel
- authenticated channel
- reliable channel
- uses asymmetric and symmetric

[%hardbreaks]
Client sends Client Hello + random number + cipher alg supported
Server replies Server Hello + select alg + random number (ask certificate from the client)
Client - creates a random pre master secret and encrypts with the public key of the server
Client + server - generate a new master secret and session id based on the pre master secret
Client - send change cipher spec based on the master secret
Server - symmetric encryption based on the new master secret
Secure channel established

OpenSSL

- open source
- private/public keys
- certificates
- S/MIME
- Time stamps

The _Heartbleed_ Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet.


==== X.509 Certificate
 An X. 509 certificate has: a subject, a Validity range, and a *public key*, and it's signed by a CA certificate authority. The certificate authority vouches for my identity.

The subject of an X. 509 certificate - *distinguished name*. +
A hierarchy:

- country (C)
- state (ST)
- Locality or city within that state (L)
- organization within that city (O)
- organizational unit within that organization (OU)
- *common name* (CN)
e.g. In the case of a certificate identifying a site, the common name has to be the *domain name* of that site.

To create a *chain of trust* - a browser to will confirm this certificate is from me. +
At the lowest level with the certificate for the site itself - signed by a certificate authority or CA. +
The certificate authority has a certificate with a subject that has a certain validity date, their own public key different from mine and their certificate is signed by a *root certificate authority*. +
The *root certificate authority* is going to have their own certificate. The Root CA will be the subject, with its own validity range, own separate public key, but the *root certificate authority's certificate is signed by itself* - *a self-signed certificate*. The root certificate - comes pre-installed in my browser. So the browser vendor has a list of root certificate authorities that they themselves trust. *They trust these certificate authorities to vouch for the identity of other certificate authorities.* These other certificate authorities, or *intermediate CAs*, can then vouch for the identity of other websites on the web.
So a certificate acb be obtained from an intermediate certificate authority, but not from a root certificate authority.  not sign anybody else's certificate in order to vouch for their identity(only CAs can). -  strict chain of trust.

==== Cryptography standards - RSA Security
The public Key cryptography standards - a set of *standard formats for files* that you could use to exchange keys with other people.

- PKCS #7 - Cryptographic Message Syntax, - a way of exchanging certificates.
- PKCS #10 - a way of exchanging certificate requests.
- PKCS #12 - a way of storing personal information - *private keys*.

Private Key Commonly stored in files with extensions e.g. *.key for an RSA key*. Command `openssl genrsa` in order to create a key file.
File *.csr* - *a certificate signing request*. Command `openssl req` to generate such a request.
File *.cer* - the certificate authority gives us after the certificate signing request is granted. - contains an actual certificate.

All three of these file formats are usually stored in a *pem format* - *Privacy Enhanced Mail* and was a text-based format for exchanging keys that the PKCS built upon.
Format *.pfx* - a pkcs12 file sorted as binary. A pfx file stores a certificate and the private key associated with that certificate. Command `openssl pkcs12` in order to combine those two into a .pfx file.

==== RSA Key Pair
Generate a private key with a 2048 bit modulus- encrypted with an aes256 key generated from the passphrase entered.
`openssl genrsa -aes256 -out site.key 2048`
Naked key - without being encrypted - no pass needed - should only be on the server what will use the key
`openssl rsa -in site.key -out rawsite.key`

==== Certificate Signing Request
Generate a CSR
`openssl req -new -key site.key -days 365 -out site.csr`
Provide the distinguish name -> country, state, locality, organization name, organization unit name, *Common name* -> domain name www.site.com
Read the csr
`openssl req -text -in site.csr`
Contains: subject, public key, signature algorithm (sha1withRSAEncryption), contents of PEM format
File - printed out in pem format with BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST and END CERTIFICATE REQUEST delimiters.
Base64 encoded block of binary.

==== Certificate
CA will send the cer - certificate - a PEM-encoded certificate - contains a Base64 encoded version of my certificate.
Command `openssl x509 -in site.cer -text`
Contains: distinguish name of the issuer, validity dates, subject of the certificate - CN is the same, public key,  certificate signing authority signature(sha1withRSAEncryption)

To generate a file for IIS/Tomcat
Command `openssl pks12 -export -in site.cer -inkey site.key -out site.pfx`
pfx - is binary format


==== Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

- encrypting messages and files
- signing
- deleting files
- compression

1. User encrypts data -> PGP uses compression
2. PGP creates a random key and encrypts the plaintext
3. Random key is encrypted with the recipient's public key
4. Random key is attached and sent to the recipient
5. Sign the message with the private key of the sender



=== Authentication and Authorization
- Hashed passwords - hash function - one way digest of the passwords
Precomputed hashes - dictionary attack

Rainbow table
Hash(text) -> binary SHA-1
Retry(binary) -> text - not the inverse function

- Salted Hashed passwords: random input to hash function

Entropy
H=Llog2N
L length of the message
N size of alphabet

- Password Based Key Derivation Functions
----
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance( "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
KeySpec ks = new PBEKeySpec( password, salt, 10000, 128);
SecretKey s = f.generateSecret(ks);
Key k = new SecretKeySpec(s.getEncoded(), "AES");
----

- Progressive Salted Hashed Passwords
Store the algorithm - hash alg and number of iterations

- Federation removes the responsibility of identity from applications and gives that to other providers.
It separates the authentication of users from their authorization. Federation is based on a trust relationship established among multiple parties. +
Federation roles:
- Identity provider - IP - centralize identity management
- Secure Token Service - STS - sigle repository of roles and responsibilities
- Relying Party - RP - consumes the tokens and acts upon those claims

Kerberos - authentication and authorization
User makes a Token Request, Server sends a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - encrypted by the user symmetric key (established from the user password - created when the user first register)

WS-Trust and WS-Federation - XML protocols for SOAP web services to exchange security tokens +
Active federation - client provides proof of identity (proof key), client signs a message to prove is the holder of a key pair +
Passive federation - browser redirects exchange tokens through cookies (no proof key), password- based authentication +
Bearer token signed by STS and encrypted for a specific RP
WS-Trust and WS-Federation exchange claims in the form of secure Assertion Markup Language, or *SAML*. +
SAML is an XML schema designed for use in web services, which *encodes both authentication and authorization claims*.
In SAML parlance they're called assertions. These assertions are signed by the STS so that they can be trusted by the relying parties. The signature is usually enveloped within the assertion and contains a reference to the assertion, usually by ID.

=== Cryptanalysis methods

Linear
- block ciphers, plaintext attack, more pairs = better successful

Differential
- symmetric key algorithms
- looks at the differences of input and output


Integral
- block ciphers
- looks at pairs of input that differ a bit

==== Code breaking methods
- Frequency analysis
- Brute force

- Trickery and deceit

=== Best practice
- No keys inside the source code
- Do not transfer keys
- Symmetric algorithms use 168 or 265 bits
- Message authentication should be done
- Asymmetric algorithms use 1536 or 2048 bits
- Hash algorithms use 168 or 256 bits

==== Don't
- Use hard-coded symmetric keys
- Embed keys in mobile apps

==== Do
- Generate a new key for each message
- Use asymmetric algorithms to securely exchange keys
- Digitally sign messages to identify the sender
