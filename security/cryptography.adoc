= Cryptography

== Purpose
- Nonrepudiation - can't claim it was not send by you
- Integrity - is the data you sent
- Authentication
- Confidentiality

=== Process
Plaintext + Encryption = Chiphertext
Chipertext + Descryption = Plaintext

Entropy - how random is a number

- One-time Pad
Truly random, used only once, maximum entropy +
hard to use

Diffie Hellman -  is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel
Large primes - 2048 bits +
Man in the Middle attack

== Types of Cryptography
=== Symmetric
Pro

- both parties use the same key
- super fast
- easy to implement
- key isn't transmitted with data

Not good

- key has to be distributed to all parties
- manageability
- look out for Dictionary Attacks
- hard to prove authenticity

=== Asymmetric
Pro

- two keys required (public and private)
- digital signature
- better security
- private key - proves your identity
- public key - sends you encrypted data

Not good

- slower and more CPU power
- not good id the private key is exposed
- MiTM and Brute force attacks
- No decryption if the private key is lost

Government Access to Key (GAK)

== Ciphers

Block ciphers - divides message into blocks (same size) - encrypts each block individual. +
Whereas confusion serves to hide the key, diffusion serves to hide patterns within the original message.

=== Initialization vector
to initialize the cipher block chain with a *random* vector each time we encrypt a message. +
This initialization vector is the *same size as our block size* and gives us a random starting point for our cipher block chaining.

Encrypt a message with a public key of the receiver.
Receiver uses the private key to decrypt the email and read it.

CA - issues digital certificates - trusted 3rd party
Verisign, thawte, Entrust, GoDady, DigiCert
- issues, revoking, distributes certificates

Certificate - identifying a user/org, public key, alg, issuer, subject name

Signed certificate - signed by a public CA, private key is kept secret by the CA
Self-signed certificate - signed by the same org

 When a certificate authority issues a certificate, it *signs it with its private key*.

Certificate authorities hierarchy: root certificate authorities and intermediate certificate authorities, or subcertificate authorities

* the certificate chain, or certificate path - the web browser must be able to build a certificate chain that starts from the web application certificate until it reaches a root certificate

Each X.509 certificate has an issuer field, which is used to find the certificate of the issuing authority. The certificate of the issuing authority contains the public key of the authority, which is used to verify the signature on the issued certificate. When a matching certificate is found, the chain grows one more knot. The process repeats itself until a trusted root certificate is reached.

== Encrypting Emails, File and Disk drives

=== Java Cryptography Extensions JCE
*KeyGenerator* generates *SecretKeys* +
SecretKeys are used for symmetric encryption algorithms like AES.

On the asymmetric side -> *KeyPairGenerator* gives a *PublicKey and a PrivateKey*.

Also at this generative level we have *SecureRandom* - a cryptographically strong random number generator and *IvParameterSpec* - an initialization vector for block ciphers. +
The keys in the initialization vectors go into creating *Cipher* and *Signature* classes - perform the work of the symmetric or asymmetric encryption and signatures +
CipherInputStream and CipherOutputStream -  Java input and output stream pipeline in order to pass an entire message through a block cipher.

=== Digital Signatures
Digital Signature is a technique for ensuring:

* *Integrity*: the message hasn't been altered in transit
* *Authenticity*: the author of the message is really who they claim to be
* *Non-repudiation*: the author of the message can't later deny that they were the source

==== Sending a Message with a Digital Signature
A digital signature is the *encrypted hash (digest, checksum) of a message*. +
That means we generate a hash from a message and encrypt it with a private key according to a chosen algorithm. +
The message, the encrypted hash, the corresponding public key, and the algorithm are all then sent.

==== Receiving and Checking a Digital Signature
To check the digital signature, the message receiver generates a new hash from the received message, decrypts the received encrypted hash using the public key, and compares them.
Only it is encrypted the message hash, and not the message itself

Verify an email was send by the real person.
The email is signed with the private key of the sender,
and is verified with the public key of the sender by the receiver.

*Confidentiality*
- encrypt a message and then send the secret key that we used to encrypt the message to just the person that we want to be able to read it.
- encrypt symmetric key with public key
- confidence that only recipient can read it

*Authenticity*
- guarantee that the message came from a particular source.
- to take a digest of the original message.
- *A digest* is simply a *hash*, a smaller number computed from the larger message.
- Using our private key, we can encrypt the digest, which digitally signs the original message.
- The recipient can compute the same digest using the hash function and then decrypt our signature using our public key.
- If the two match, then the signature is valid. So in order for this to work, we have to choose an *appropriate hashing function*.

- CRC-32* - CRC is Cyclic Redundancy Check
- 32 means that this hash produces a 32 bit number.
- CRC-32 is a polynomial on 33 bits, but only 32 bits of the result are stored.
- this polynomial is easily reversible.

==== Digital Certificate and Public Key Identity
A certificate is a document that associates an identity to a given public key.
A Digital Certificate contains a public key and is itself signed by another entity. The signature of that entity can itself be verified by another entity and so on. - *certificate chain*
The most *top-level entity is self-signed*, which means that his public key is signed by his own private key.

The X.509 is the most used certificate format, and it is shipped either as binary format (DER) or text format (PEM).

===== Loading the Private Key for Signing
----
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
keyStore.load(new FileInputStream("sender_keystore.p12"), "changeit");
PrivateKey privateKey =
  (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey("senderKeyPair", "changeit");
----

==== Loading a Public Key for Verification
----
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
keyStore.load(new FileInputStream("receiver_keytore.p12"), "changeit");
Certificate certificate = keyStore.getCertificate("receiverKeyPair");
PublicKey publicKey = certificate.getPublicKey();
----

==== Hashing Algorithms
Both the SHA-2 and the SHA-3 family are considered cryptographically secure.

==== Digital Signature With MessageDigest and Cipher Classes
===== Generating a Message Hash
A message can be a string, a file, or any other data. So let's take the content of a simple file:
----
byte[] messageBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("message.txt"));
----

Using MessageDigest -> use the digest method to generate a hash:
----
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
byte[] messageHash = md.digest(messageBytes);
----

===== Encrypting the Generated Hash
o encrypt a message, we need an algorithm and a private key. Here we'll use the RSA algorithm. The DSA algorithm is another option.

----
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, privateKey);
byte[] digitalSignature = cipher.doFinal(messageHash);
----
The signature can be saved into a file for sending it later:
----
Files.write(Paths.get("digital_signature_1"), digitalSignature);
----

==== Verifying Signature
----
byte[] encryptedMessageHash =
Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("digital_signature_1"));
----
For decryption, we create a Cipher instance. Then we call the doFinal method:
----
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, publicKey);
byte[] decryptedMessageHash = cipher.doFinal(encryptedMessageHash);
----

Generate a new message hash from the received message:
----
byte[] messageBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("message.txt"));

MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
byte[] newMessageHash = md.digest(messageBytes);
----
Check if the newly generated message hash matches the decrypted one:
----
boolean isCorrect = Arrays.equals(decryptedMessageHash, newMessageHash);
----

=== Digital Signature Using the Signature Class
JCA already offers a dedicated API in the form of the Signature class.

==== Signing a Message
----
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
signature.initSign(privateKey);
----
The signing algorithm we chose, SHA256withRSA in this example, is a *combination of a hashing algorithm and an encryption algorithm*. Other alternatives include SHA1withRSA, SHA1withDSA, and MD5withRSA,

----
byte[] messageBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("message.txt"));

signature.update(messageBytes);
byte[] digitalSignature = signature.sign();
----

Save the signature into a file for later transmission:
----
Files.write(Paths.get("digital_signature_2"), digitalSignature);
----

==== Verifying the Signature
Create a Signature instance:
----
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
----
Initialize the Signature object for verification by calling the initVerify method, which takes a public key:
----
signature.initVerify(publicKey);
----

Add the received message bytes to the signature object by invoking the update method:
----
byte[] messageBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("message.txt"));

signature.update(messageBytes);
----
Check the signature by calling the verify method:
----
boolean isCorrect = signature.verify(receivedSignature);
----

=== SSL Secure Sockets Layer/ TLS Transport Layer Security
Secured Socket Layer (SSL) enables a secured connection between two parties.

SSL is necessary to support the three main information security principles:

* Encryption: protect data transmissions between parties
* Authentication: ensure the server we connect to is indeed the proper server
* Data integrity: guarantee that the requested data is what is effectively delivered

- private channel
- authenticated channel
- reliable channel
- uses asymmetric and symmetric

[%hardbreaks]
Client sends Client Hello + random number + cipher alg supported
Server replies Server Hello + select alg + random number (ask certificate from the client)
Client - creates a random pre master secret and encrypts with the public key of the server
Client + server - generate a new master secret and session id based on the pre master secret
Client - send change cipher spec based on the master secret
Server - symmetric encryption based on the new master secret
Secure channel established

HTTPS - Http over TLS - combination provides is that all HTTP requests are first passed to the TLS layer where it gets protected before it is passed to the TCP layer to be sent to the network and finally to the web application.

 TLS meets this gap by asking the web application to provide as part of the *handshake an artifact called X.509 certificate* +
*X.509 certificates* contain a subject, a validity period, and allowed usages, the web application public asymmetric key, which is basically the public portion of the key pair that the web application holds and uses to identify itself.

Checks performed by the browser to check authentication:

- the name of the web application matches the subject field in the certificate.
- this certificate has not expired
- the certificate contains a usage field that allows the web application to use it to authenticate itself to clients. This usage field is called server authentication.
- the certificate was issued by a trusted authority.

If a check fails on the provided X.509 certificate, the web browser will immediately notify the user that the browser is not sure whether it is communicating with the intended web application.

To protect sensitive data from exposure - the TLS protocol requires that the web browser:
- *generate a random secret*
- encrypt that secret with the asymmetric public key in the provided web application X.509 certificate
- send it to the web application +
 Now both the web browser and the web application have *a short secret which they will use to generate a common symmetric encryption key*, which will later be used to encrypt all the traffic that passes between the web browser and the web application. In our case, all HTTP requests that pass the TLS layer will get encrypted with this symmetric key.

*Typical steps in an SSL handshake are:*

* Client provides a list of possible SSL version and cipher suites to use
* Server agrees on a particular SSL version and cipher suite, responding back with its certificate
* Client extracts the public key from the certificate responds back with an encrypted “pre-master key”
* Server decrypts the “pre-master key” using its private key
* Client and server compute a “shared secret” using the exchanged “pre-master key”
* Client and server exchange messages confirming the successful encryption and decryption using the “shared secret”

*OWASP Recommendations*

* Keep sensitive data out of the URL
** Web browsers cache the URL history +
** Referrer header
* TLS everywhere
** Never rely on network access control
** All authenticated pages served over TLS - No parts make HTTP requests
* Strong protocols
** Never use SSL 1, 2 or 3
** Use strong ciphers


OpenSSL

- open source
- private/public keys
- certificates
- S/MIME
- Time stamps

The _Heartbleed_ Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet.

* Java Secured-Socket Extension (JSSE)
* Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
* Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE)

==== JSSE API
===== SSLSocketFactory
javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory is used for creating SSLSocket objects.

* single static getDefault() method used to retrieve the default instance which, in turn, can create SSLSocket instances

----
Socket createSocket(String host, int port)
Socket createSocket(String host, int port, InetAddress clientHost, int clientPort)
Socket createSocket(InetAddress host, int port)
Socket createSocket(InetAddress host, int port, InetAddress clientHost, int clientPort)
Socket createSocket(Socket socket, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)
----

===== SSLSocket
SSLSocket instances construct an SSL connection to a named host at a specified port.

===== SSLServerSocketFactory
creates SSLServerSocket instances

===== SSLServerSocket
The methods on SSLServerSocket class are a subset of the SSLSocket class methods.

----
String host = getHost(...);
Integer port = getPort(...);
SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory
  .createSocket(host, port);
InputStream in = sslsocket.getInputStream();
OutputStream out = sslsocket.getOutputStream();

out.write(1);
while (in.available() > 0) {
    System.out.print(in.read());
}

System.out.println("Secured connection performed successfully");
----

Add certificate in the truststore:

* add the public certificate of the server to the default cacerts truststore used by Java. while initiating the SSL connection
* Set the javax.net.ssl.trustStore environment variable to point to the truststore file so that the application can pick up that file which contains the public certificate of the server we are connecting to.

The steps to install a new certificate into the Java default truststore are:

* extract cert from server: `openssl s_client -connect server:443`
import certificate into truststore using `keytool: keytool -import -alias alias.server.com -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`

==== X.509 Certificate
 An X. 509 certificate has: a subject, a Validity range, and a *public key*, and it's signed by a CA certificate authority. The certificate authority vouches for my identity.

The subject of an X. 509 certificate - *distinguished name*. +
A hierarchy:

- country (C)
- state (ST)
- Locality or city within that state (L)
- organization within that city (O)
- organizational unit within that organization (OU)
- *common name* (CN)
e.g. In the case of a certificate identifying a site, the common name has to be the *domain name* of that site.

To create a *chain of trust* - a browser to will confirm this certificate is from me. +
At the lowest level with the certificate for the site itself - signed by a certificate authority or CA. +
The certificate authority has a certificate with a subject that has a certain validity date, their own public key different from mine and their certificate is signed by a *root certificate authority*. +
The *root certificate authority* is going to have their own certificate. The Root CA will be the subject, with its own validity range, own separate public key, but the *root certificate authority's certificate is signed by itself* - *a self-signed certificate*. The root certificate - comes pre-installed in my browser. So the browser vendor has a list of root certificate authorities that they themselves trust. *They trust these certificate authorities to vouch for the identity of other certificate authorities.* These other certificate authorities, or *intermediate CAs*, can then vouch for the identity of other websites on the web.
So a certificate acb be obtained from an intermediate certificate authority, but not from a root certificate authority.  not sign anybody else's certificate in order to vouch for their identity(only CAs can). -  strict chain of trust.



==== Cryptography standards - RSA Security
The public Key cryptography standards - a set of *standard formats for files* that you could use to exchange keys with other people.

- PKCS #7 - Cryptographic Message Syntax, - a way of exchanging certificates.
- PKCS #10 - a way of exchanging certificate requests.
- PKCS #12 - a way of storing personal information - *private keys*.

Private Key Commonly stored in files with extensions e.g. *.key for an RSA key*. Command `openssl genrsa` in order to create a key file. +
File *.csr* - *a certificate signing request*. Command `openssl req` to generate such a request. +
File *.cer* - the certificate authority gives us after the certificate signing request is granted. - contains an actual certificate. +

All three of these file formats are usually stored in a *pem format* - *Privacy Enhanced Mail* and was a text-based format for exchanging keys that the PKCS built upon.
Format *.pfx* - a pkcs12 file sorted as binary. A pfx file stores a certificate and the private key associated with that certificate. Command `openssl pkcs12` in order to combine those two into a .pfx file.

==== RSA Key Pair
Generate a private key with a 2048 bit modulus- encrypted with an aes256 key generated from the passphrase entered.
`openssl genrsa -aes256 -out site.key 2048`
Naked key - without being encrypted - no pass needed - should only be on the server what will use the key
`openssl rsa -in site.key -out rawsite.key`

==== Certificate Signing Request
Generate a CSR
`openssl req -new -key site.key -days 365 -out site.csr`
Provide the distinguish name -> country, state, locality, organization name, organization unit name, *Common name* -> domain name www.site.com
Read the csr
`openssl req -text -in site.csr`
Contains: subject, public key, signature algorithm (sha1withRSAEncryption), contents of PEM format
File - printed out in pem format with BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST and END CERTIFICATE REQUEST delimiters.
Base64 encoded block of binary.

==== Certificate
CA will send the cer - certificate - a PEM-encoded certificate - contains a Base64 encoded version of my certificate.
Command `openssl x509 -in site.cer -text`
Contains: distinguish name of the issuer, validity dates, subject of the certificate - CN is the same, public key,  certificate signing authority signature(sha1withRSAEncryption)

To generate a file for IIS/Tomcat
Command `openssl pks12 -export -in site.cer -inkey site.key -out site.pfx`
pfx - is binary format


==== Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

- encrypting messages and files
- signing
- deleting files
- compression

1. User encrypts data -> PGP uses compression
2. PGP creates a random key and encrypts the plaintext
3. Random key is encrypted with the recipient's public key
4. Random key is attached and sent to the recipient
5. Sign the message with the private key of the sender



=== Authentication and Authorization
- Hashed passwords - hash function - one way digest of the passwords
Precomputed hashes - dictionary attack

Rainbow table
Hash(text) -> binary SHA-1
Retry(binary) -> text - not the inverse function

- Salted Hashed passwords: random input to hash function

Entropy
H=Llog2N
L length of the message
N size of alphabet

- Password Based Key Derivation Functions
----
SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance( "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
KeySpec ks = new PBEKeySpec( password, salt, 10000, 128);
SecretKey s = f.generateSecret(ks);
Key k = new SecretKeySpec(s.getEncoded(), "AES");
----

- Progressive Salted Hashed Passwords
Store the algorithm - hash alg and number of iterations

- Federation removes the responsibility of identity from applications and gives that to other providers.
It separates the authentication of users from their authorization. Federation is based on a trust relationship established among multiple parties. +
Federation roles:
- Identity provider - IP - centralize identity management
- Secure Token Service - STS - sigle repository of roles and responsibilities
- Relying Party - RP - consumes the tokens and acts upon those claims

Kerberos - authentication and authorization
User makes a Token Request, Server sends a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - encrypted by the user symmetric key (established from the user password - created when the user first register)

WS-Trust and WS-Federation - XML protocols for SOAP web services to exchange security tokens +
Active federation - client provides proof of identity (proof key), client signs a message to prove is the holder of a key pair +
Passive federation - browser redirects exchange tokens through cookies (no proof key), password- based authentication +
Bearer token signed by STS and encrypted for a specific RP
WS-Trust and WS-Federation exchange claims in the form of secure Assertion Markup Language, or *SAML*. +
SAML is an XML schema designed for use in web services, which *encodes both authentication and authorization claims*.
In SAML parlance they're called assertions. These assertions are signed by the STS so that they can be trusted by the relying parties. The signature is usually enveloped within the assertion and contains a reference to the assertion, usually by ID.

XML Signature Wrapping Attacks
Move assertions inside body, and in the header reference the valid assertion in the body.


=== Password management
- Salted hashes
Precomputed tables will not practically work Hide two identical passwords +
Use unique salt per credential +
- Use cryptographically strong random data generator +
Never depend on hiding or obscurity of salts +
*OWASP* recommends using the following hashing functions configured with the right work factor:
Argon2 -  first choice for new applications - the winner of the password hashing competition. +
PBKDF2 - Password-based key derivation function 2 should be used when FIPS certification or enterprise support on many platforms is required. +
Scrypt should be used when resisting any or all hardware accelerated attacks is necessary. +
Bcrypt should be used when support for password-based key derivation function 2 or Scrypt is not available.

OWASP also recommends using *keyed hash functions*, or HMACs, which are hash functions that use a private key to calculate the results. +
Password length and character variety, OWASP suggests setting:

- a maximum length for passwords - a reasonable long password length of 160 characters
- without limiting the character set because limited character sets facilitate brute-force attacks.

OWASP suggests hashing the password as one of several steps before storing it.
very large passwords - a performance bottleneck.
But when hashed, the size of the password will be reduced to the output size of the hashing function. +
Finally, OWASP recommends designing password storage with eventual compromise in mind, or designing for failure, in other words.



=== JWT JSON Web Token
Security tokens are (protected) data structures
- contain information about issuer and subject (claims)
- signed (tamper proof & authenticity)
- typically contain an expiration time

 A client requests a token
 An issuer issues a token
 A resource consumes a token - has a trust relationship with the issuer

==== JWT Structure and Format
* Header: metadata and algorithms & keys used
* Claims
** Issuer (iss)
** Audience (aud)
** IssuedAt(iat)
** Expiration (exp)
** Subject (sub)
** Application defined claims

JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
- Header
- Payload
- Signature

 a JWT typically looks like the following - `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

Header:

the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA
----
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
----
this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

Payload:

three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
----
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
----
The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.

Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:
----
HMACSHA256(
base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
base64UrlEncode(payload),
secret)
----
The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

String jwt = Jwts.builder()
  .setSubject("users/TzMUocMF4p")
  .setExpiration(new Date(1300819380))
  .claim("name", "Robert Token Man")
  .claim("scope", "self groups/admins")
  .signWith(
    SignatureAlgorithm.HS256,
    "secret".getBytes("UTF-8")
  )
  .compact();

Validating +
----
String jwt = <jwt passed in from above>
Jws<Claims> claims = Jwts.parser()
  .setSigningKey("secret".getBytes("UTF-8"))
  .parseClaimsJws(jwt)
String scope = claims.getBody().get("scope")
assertEquals(scope, "self groups/admins");

=== Cryptanalysis methods

Linear
- block ciphers, plaintext attack, more pairs = better successful

Differential
- symmetric key algorithms
- looks at the differences of input and output


Integral
- block ciphers
- looks at pairs of input that differ a bit

==== Code breaking methods
- Frequency analysis
- Brute force

- Trickery and deceit

=== Best practice
- No keys inside the source code
- Do not transfer keys
- Symmetric algorithms use 168 or 265 bits
- Message authentication should be done
- Asymmetric algorithms use 1536 or 2048 bits
- Hash algorithms use 168 or 256 bits

==== Don't
- Use hard-coded symmetric keys
- Embed keys in mobile apps

==== Do
- Generate a new key for each message
- Use asymmetric algorithms to securely exchange keys
- Digitally sign messages to identify the sender
