= Networking protocols

* IP - Internet Protocol
connectionless protocol - responsible for networking addressing, provides routing of packets between networks

* TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
connection oriented that establishes connections between endpoints, provides guaranteed delivery of packets

* UDP - User Datagram Protocol
connectionless oriented protocol with no guarantee of delivery (best effort)

== TCP Three way handshake
- A client node sends a SYN data packet over an IP network to a server to determine if the server is open for a new connection
- The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. Server responds and returns a confirmation receipt (SYN/ACK packet)
- The client receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet and establishes a connection

* Step 1 (SYN): In the first step, the client wants to establish a connection with a server, so it sends a segment with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs the server that the client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
* Step 2 (SYN + ACK): Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of the segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
* Step 3 (ACK): In the final part client acknowledges the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer

== Protocols

=== DNS Security Extensions - DNSSEC
- Adds security to the original DNS (hierarchical naming system to URLSs to IP addresses)
- All responses from DNSSEC servers (protected zones) are digitally signed, authenticating their origin
- Does not provide confidentiality

=== Main security issues
- DNS Hijacking
- DNS Cache Poisoning

=== SSH Secure Shell
- logging into remote hosts
- TCP Port 22

=== S/MIME Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- Public key encryption and signing of MIME data
- Sending/receiving users - should obtain a key/certificate
- end-to-end encryption defeat malware scanners

=== SRTP Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol
- adds confidentiality, message authentication and replay protection
- to secure VoIP traffic

=== LDAPS Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) over SSL
- TCP/UDP POrt 636
- secures traffic over SSL/TLS

=== FTPS File Transfer over SSL
- secure file transfers that use SSL for encryption
- encryption can be turned off if other encryption is in user (e.g. IPSec)
- TCP ports 989 and 990

=== SFTP Secure FTP
- SSH File Transfer Protocol
- provides remote file transfer, access and management
- Ftp over SSH is FTP tunneled through SSH connection
- TCP port 115

=== SNMPv3 Simple Network Management Protocol
- remote management and reporting od IP devices
- UDP port 161

=== SSL/TLS Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
- TCL new, SSL old
- adds confidentiality and data integrity by encapsulating other protocols
- initiates stateful session with handshake

=== HTTPS HTTP Secure via SSL or TLS
- authentication, privacy/integrity of the data exchange
- protects against eavesdropping an MiTM attacks
- bidirectional encryption client/server
- TCP Port 443

=== Secure POP/IMAP
-  Accessing webmail securely using SSL/TLS
- POP3 TCP Port 110/995 (ssl)
- IMAP4 TCP Port 143/ 993 (ssl)
