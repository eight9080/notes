= TLS - Transport Layer Security

== Overview
* A cryptographic protocol for secure internet communication
* An agreed message and handshake structure for parties to:
** Agree cryptographic parameters
** Establish secret keys
** Authenticate identities
** Transmit messages

== The TLS Handshake

The TLS handshake protocol is used to establish parameters for the remainder of the session:

* Agree ciphers and protocols
* Establish shared secrets
* Authenticate the server(and the client)
* Be robust to tampering and attack

=== Cipher suites

=== Flow

1. Client Hello:

** Max supported TLS version
** Random number
** List of supported cipher suites

2. Server Hello:
** Chosen TLS version
** Random number
** Chosen cipher suite

3. Certificate:
** The server sends public key certificate +
__PKI The client checks that the public key certificate is valid using a root certificate__

4. ServerKeyExchange:

** Key exchange parameters
** Key exchange public value
** Digital signature +
__Authentication: The client checks that the digital signature is valid__

5. Certificate request (for the client certificate - if mutual TLS)

6. ServerHelloDone

7. Client responds with certificate (for mTLS)

8. ClientKeyExchange

** Key exchange public value
(Establish a master secret)

9. ChangeCipherSpec

Finished: MAC(summary) of all previous messages

TLS 1.2:

== TLS 1.3

* Major handshake improvements
* All ciphers removed except for modern AEAD
* Key exchange and authentication separated from ciphers

Differences:

* The handshake embeds the key exchange into the hello messages
* The client guesses a key sharing algorithm in the ClientHello step
* If the key is not supported, the server sends a HelloRetryRequest
* Encryption begins during the second message

0-RTT Resumption:

In app data, the server can send a pre shared key for use in next request.

== Public Key Infrastructure - PKI

=== Digital Certificates

A trusted third party in order to verify the ownership of a public key

Certificates usually held in *X509 format*

==== Certificate Issuance

* A server creates a *Certificate Signing Request* CSR
* A Certification Authority (CA) uses this to create and sign a certificate
