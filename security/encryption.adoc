= Encryption

== Overview

image::encryptionGeneral.png[Encryption]

XOR is a binary operator between two values that returns true if either one input or the other is true, but not both

|===
|I 1 |I 2 |Output 3

|0 |0 |0
|1 |0 |1
|0 |1 |1
|1 |1 |0

A XOR B XOR A = B

== Symmetric Cryptography

* Stream cipher
* Block cipher

Nonce - number used once

=== Stream cipher

Approximate a one-time pad by generating an infinite pseudo-random keystream

image::streamCiphers.png[Stream ciphers]

=== Block Ciphers
*  Block ciphers take an input of a fixed size, and return an output of the same size
*  Block ciphers attempt to hide the transformation from message to ciphertext through confusion, and diffusion

SP-Networks:

* Repeated substitution and permutation operations
** Replacing bytes with others
** Swapping bytes around

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an SP-Network

==== AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
* Key length of 128, 192 or 256-bits
* 10, 12 or 14 rounds
* Each Round: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, Key Addition

=== Modes of operation

Modes of operation combine multiple instances of block encryption into a usable protocol

==== Electronic Code Book (ECB)
* Just encrypt each block one after another
* Weak to redundant data divulging patterns

==== Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
XOR the output of each cipher block with the next input.
(with issues)

* slow
* no parallelization
IV - Initialization vector

==== Counter Mode (CTR)

Encrypting a counter to produce a stream cipher

* can be parallelized

== Asymmetric Cryptography

Two keys: a public key and a private key

_It is computationally infeasible to calculate a private from a public key_

=== Key Exchange

==== Diffie-Hellman

Two parties can jointly *agree a shared secret over an insecure channel*

Steps:

1. Alice and Bob agree on a large prime [BLUE]#p#, and a generator [BLUE]#g# that is a primitive root of p
2. Alice chooses a private value [RED]#a# at random, then sends Bob a public (g power a) mod p
3. Bob chooses a private value [RED]#b# at random, then sends Alice a public (g power b) mod p
4. Alice computes ((g power b) power a) mod p, which is actually (g power ab) mod p
5. Bob computes ((g power a) power b) mod p, which is actually (g power ab) mod p

==== Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic curves are a drop-in replacement for the mathematics underpinning regular Diffie-Hellman

* more efficient than DFH

Elliptic curves are much stronger than traditional public-key schemes for the same key length.

Use Ephemeral Mode:

* In most protocols, running Diffie-Hellman in ephemeral mode forces a new key exchange every time

== Public-Key Cryptography

=== RSA

* RSA is the most common method for general public key cryptography • It provides both encryption and/or authentication
* RSA provides us with two keys:

** Public (e,n)
** Private (d)

e - small number +
d - much larger number +
n - very large semi-prime number n = p*q

* The keys (e, n) and (d) are reversible – either can be used for encryption, and the other used for decryption
* Everyone knows the public key, only the owner knows the private key
* This leads us to two very useful use cases for RSA:

1. Encryption only the owner can read
2. Signing that must have been performed by the owner

=== DSA
• The main alternative to RSA is The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
• It acts a lot like RSA, but uses mathematics similar to Diffie- Hellman
• It doesn’t encrypt, but can be used for signing messages

== Hash Functions

Takes a message of any length, and returns a pseudorandom hash of
fixed length

Strong Hash Functions:

1. Given a hash, we can’t reverse it
2. Given a message and its hash, we can’t find another message that hashes to the same thing
3. We can’t find any two messages that have the same hash
4. For the same input the same hash is computed

Usually hash functions iteratively jumble blocks of a message after another.

== Message Authentication Code

Hashing lets us ensure that a message(symmetric encryption) hasn’t been altered

Ciphertext:C | h(K|C)

HMAC is the most common approach, it splits a key in two and hashes twice

== Digital Signatures – Hashing + PK
• Hashes are used with RSA and DSA to create digital signatures
• They prove the authenticity of the sender
