= Authentication

== Broken Authentication

*Vultneabilities*

1. missing authetication for critical function
Solution - check authentication for each operation and have in place security tests (automated) to check the operations
2. improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts
  Countermeasures:
  - add delay: constant, back-off algortithms, hashing rounds
  - disconnect user
  - add chanllenge: captcha, MFA, TAN-code
  - banning remote hosts - by IP address
  
3. Use of hard-coded credentials
Inbound

Authentication mechanism checks input against hard-coded data
Solution- first login mode

Outbound

Connects to another system using hard-coded credentials for that system
Solution
If any key needs to be stored, encrypt the key itself.
Descryption can be only done at statup or runtime.
