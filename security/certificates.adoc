= SSL certificate

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a global standard security technology that enables encrypted communication between a web browser and a web server.


To create this secure connection, an SSL certificate is installed on a web server and serves two functions:

* It authenticates the identity of the website
* It encrypts the data that’s being transmitted

SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), organizations that are trusted to verify the identity and legitimacy of any entity requesting a certificate.

The CA’s role is to accept certificate applications, authenticate applications, issue certificates, and maintain status information on certificates issued.
