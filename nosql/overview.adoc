== Different Types of NoSql databases

*RDBMS*

Relational databases are used for transactional needs (storing financial data, reporting requirements, etc.)

=== MongoDB
Documented oriented databases are used for documents oriented needs (for e.g. Product Catalog). Documents are schema free so changes in the schema can be accommodated into application without much headache.

=== Cassandra/Amazon DynamoDB
Key-value pair based database (User activity tracking, Analytics, etc.). DynamoDB can store documents as well as key-value pairs.

=== Redis
In memory distributed database (user session tracking), its mostly used as distributed cache among multiple microservices.

=== Neo4j
Graph DB (social connections, recommendations, etc)
