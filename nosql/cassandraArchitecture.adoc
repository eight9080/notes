= Casandra Architecture

== Data Centers and Racks

* used in systems spanning physically separate locations

A *rack* is a logical set of nodes in close proximity to each other, perhaps on physical machines in a single rack of equipment.  +
A *data center* is a logical set of racks, perhaps located in the same building and connected by reliable network.

Default configuration: a single data center ("datacenter1") containing a single rack ("rack1")

== Gossip and Failure Detection

Cassandra uses a gossip protocol that allows each node to keep track of state information about the other nodes in the cluster. The gossiper runs every second on a timer.

Gossip protocols generally assume a faulty network, are commonly employed in very large, decentralized network systems, and are often used as an automatic mechanism for replication in distributed databases.
