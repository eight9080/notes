= Data Modeling

== Conceptual Data Modeling

Conceptual domain includes hotels, guests that stay in the hotels, a collection of rooms for each hotel, the rates and availability of those rooms, and a record of reservations booked for guests. Hotels typically also maintain a collection of “points of interest,” which are parks, museums

== Design Differences Between RDBMS and Cassandra

* NO JOINS

    ** cannot perform joins in Cassandra
    ** Performing joins on the client should be a very rare case
    ** create a denormalized second table that represents the join results (duplicate)

* NO REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY

    ** still a common design requirement to store IDs related to other entities in your tables, but operations such as cascading deletes are not available.

* DENORMALIZATION

    ** business document structure that requires retention.

* QUERY-FIRST DESIGN
    ** start with the query model

* DESIGNING FOR OPTIMAL STORAGE
    ** Cassandra tables are each stored in separate files on disk, it’s important to keep related columns defined together in the same table.
    ** to minimize the number of partitions that must be searched in order to satisfy a given query
    ** the partition is a unit of storage that does not get divided across nodes

* SORTING IS A DESIGN DECISION
    ** The sort order available on queries is fixed, and is determined entirely by the selection of clustering columns you supply in the CREATE TABLE command.
    ** The CQL SELECT statement does support ORDER BY semantics, but only in the order specified by the clustering columns (ascending or descending).

== Defining Application Queries

1. Find hotels near a given point of interest.
2. Find information about a given hotel, such as its name and location.
3. Find points of interest near a given hotel.
4. Find an available room in a given date range.
5. Find the rate and amenities for a room.

6. Look up a reservation by confirmation number.
7. Look up a reservation by hotel, date, and guest name.
8. Look up all reservations by guest name.
9. View guest details.

== Logical Data Modeling

* a table for each query, capturing entities and relationships from the conceptual model

* To name each table, identify the primary entity type for which you are querying, and use that to start the entity name. e.g. hotels_by_poi

* identify the primary key for the table, adding partition key columns based on the required query attributes, and clustering columns in order to guarantee uniqueness and support desired sort ordering.

Notation:

* K for partition key columns
* C↑ or C↓ to represent clustering columns

=== Hotel Logical Data Model

IMPORTANT: Use clustering columns to store attributes that you need to access in a range query.

NOTE: *THE WIDE PARTITION PATTERN* - to group multiple related rows in a partition in order to support fast access to multiple rows within the partition in a single query.

=== Reservation Logical Data Model

Denormalized design -> the same data appears in multiple tables, with differing keys.

image::logicalDataModel2.png[Logical Data Model 2]

NOTE: *Time series pattern* - a series of measurements at specific time intervals are stored in a wide partition, where the measurement time is used as part of the partition key

WARNING: The queue anti-pattern serves as a reminder that any design that relies on the deletion of data is potentially a poorly performing design.

== Physical Data Modeling

* each of your logical model tables, assigning types to each item

Types: including the basic types, collections, and user-defined types

Notation:

S- Static column, IDX - Secondary index column, ++ - Counter column +
[column_name] - list collection column +
{column} - set collection column +
<column> - map collection column +
*column* - UDT column
(column) - Tuple column
column - regular column

=== Hotel Physical Data Model

Hotel keyspace to contain tables for hotel and availability data +
Reservation keyspace to contain tables for reservation and guest data

Type - uuid type - use unique IDs to uniquely reference elements

== Evaluating and Refining

=== Calculating Partition Size

Partition size is measured by the number of cells (values) that are stored in the partition. +
The recommended size of a partition is not more than 100,000 cells.

Nv=Nr(Nc−Npk−Ns)+Ns

number of values (or cells) in the partition(Nv) = number of rows(Nr) * (number of of values per row) + number of static columns(Ns)

number of values per row = number of columns (Nc) - number of primary key columns (Npk) - static columns (Ns)

E.g.
available_rooms_by_hotel_date - table +
four columns total (Nc = 4) +
three primary key columns (Npk = 3)  +
no static columns (Ns = 0)

Nv=Nr(4−3−0)+0=1Nr

The table is storing a record for each room, in each of your hotels, for every night. +
To store 2 years of inventory at a time, and there are 5,000 hotels in the system, with an average of 100 rooms in each hotel

Nr=100rooms/hotel×730days=73,000rows

=== Calculating Size on Disk

Size St of a partition:

image::diskSize.png[Disk Size]

* Ck refers to partition key columns
* Cs to static columns
* Cr to regular columns
* Cc to clustering columns.

* TERMavg refers to the average number of bytes of metadata stored per cell, such as timestamps. (estimate of 8 bytes for this value)

* the number of rows Nr and number of values Nv

* sizeOf() function refers to the size, in bytes, of the CQL data type of each referenced column.

Partition key column: hotel_id - text - 5-character codes - 5-byte value

The clustering columns: -> 6 bytes

* the date - 4 bytes
* the room_number - 2-byte short integer

A single regular column: boolean is_available - 1 byte in size

6 bytes + 1 byte = 7 bytes

7 bytes * number of rows (73,000) = 511,000 bytes (0.51 MB)

Metadata: 73,000 * 8 bytes = 0.58 MB

Partition size = 16 bytes + 0 bytes + 0.51 MB + 0.58 MB = 1.1 MB


=== Breaking Up Large Partitions

* The technique for splitting a large partition is straightforward: add an additional column to the partition key.
* Another option is to introduce an additional column to the table to act as a sharding key, but this requires additional application logic.

* *bucketing* is often used to break the data into moderate-size partitions. For example, you could bucketize the available_rooms_by_hotel_date table by adding a month column to the partition key, perhaps represented as an integer.
