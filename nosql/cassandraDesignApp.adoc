== Hotel Application Design

=== Cassandra and Microservice Architecture

* Encapsulation

Encapsulation could also be phrased as “services that are focused on doing one thing well” or the “single responsibility principle.”

* Autonomy

Refers to the ability to independently deploy each microservice without dependence on any other microservices.

* Scalability

Microservice architecture provides a lot of flexibility by giving you the ability to run more or fewer instances of a service dynamically according to demand.

=== Microservice Architecture for a Hotel Application

Steps:

* Identifying Bounded Contexts

Hotel domain and Reservation domain

* Identifying Services

 ** Hotel service
 ** Point of interest service
 ** Inventory service
 ** Reservation service
 ** Guest service

Note:  assign tables that have a high degree of correspondence to the same service

* Designing Microservice Persistence

** POLYGLOT PERSISTENCE

|===
|Service	|Data characteristics	|Database options
|Hotel Service

|Descriptive text about hotels and their amenities, changes infrequently
|Document database (i.e., MongoDB), Cassandra, or Elasticsearch/Solr for full text search

|Point of Interest Service
|Geographic locations and descriptions of points of interest
|Cassandra or other tabular databases supporting geospatial indexes such as DataStax Enterprise

|Inventory Service
|Counts of available rooms by date, large volume of reads and writes
|Cassandra or other tabular databases

|Reservation Service
|Rooms reserved on behalf of guests, lower volume of reads and writes than inventory
|Cassandra or other tabular databases

|Guest Service
|Guest identity and contact information, possible extension point for customer and fraud analytics systems
|Cassandra, graph databases

* REPRESENTING OTHER DATABASE MODELS IN CQL

 ** Key-value models +
Key-value models can be represented in Cassandra by treating the key as the partition key. The remaining data can be stored in a value column as a text or blob type. It’s recommended not to exceed 5 MB for a single value, so consider breaking up large documents into multiple rows.

 ** Document models

  *** one based on having a well-defined schema
  *** a flexible schema approach +
  flexible schema approach involves storing nonprimary key columns in a blob
----
CREATE TABLE hotel.hotels_document (
    id text PRIMARY KEY,
    document text);
----
Reading and writing data in JSON format, introduced in Cassandra 2.2
----
cqlsh:hotel> INSERT INTO hotels JSON '{ "id": "AZ123",
  "name": "Super Hotel Suites at WestWorld",
  "phone": "1-888-999-9999",
  "address": {
    "street": "10332 E. Bucking Bronco",
    "city": "Scottsdale",
    "state_or_province": "AZ",
    "postal_code": "85255"
  }
}';
----

  ** Graph models
Graph data models are a powerful way of representing domains where the relationships between entities are as important or more important than the properties of the entities themselves.

A *property graph* consists of vertexes that represent the entities in a domain, while edges represent the relationships between vertices and can be navigated in either direction.

=== Extending Designs

* searching for hotels by name, location, or amenities

Alternatives to managing multiple denormalized tables: secondary indexes and materialized views.

==== Secondary Indexes

*NOT Allowed* -> query on a column in a Cassandra table that is not part of the primary key,

* Force it to query based on this column using the ALLOW FILTERING keyword =>
ask all of the nodes in the cluster to scan all stored SSTable files for hotels matching the provided name, because Cassandra has no indexing built on that particular column

* Create a *secondary index* for the name column

----
cqlsh:hotel> CREATE INDEX ON hotels ( name );
----

Default name: `<table name>_<column name>_idx`

* create indexes that are based on user-defined types or values stored in collections

----
cqlsh:hotel> CREATE INDEX ON hotels ( address );
cqlsh:hotel> CREATE INDEX ON hotels ( pois );
----

* Map: indexing either the keys (via the syntax KEYS(addresses)), the values (which is the default)

* remove indexes

----
cqlsh:hotels> DROP INDEX hotels_name_idx;
cqlsh:hotels> DROP INDEX hotels_address_idx;
cqlsh:hotels> DROP INDEX hotels_pois_idx;
----

NOTE: Because Cassandra partitions data across multiple nodes, each node must maintain its own copy of a secondary index based on the data stored in partitions it owns.

==== Materialized Views

WARNING: Creating indexes on columns with high cardinality tends to result in poor performance, because most or all of the nodes in the ring are queried.

Each materialized view supports queries based on a single column that is not part of the original primary key.

Materialized views incur a performance impact on writes to the base table because some reads are required to maintain this consistency.

----
cqlsh> CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW reservation.reservations_by_confirmation
  AS SELECT *
  FROM reservation.reservations_by_hotel_date
  WHERE confirm_number IS NOT NULL and hotel_id IS NOT NULL and
    start_date IS NOT NULL and room_number IS NOT NULL
  PRIMARY KEY (confirm_number, hotel_id, start_date, room_number);
----

IMPORTANT: The PRIMARY KEY clause identifies the primary key for the materialized view, which must include all of the columns in the primary key of the base table.

The WHERE clause provides support for filtering. Note that a filter must be specified for every primary key column of the materialized view, even if it is as simple as designating that the value IS NOT NULL.

=== Reservation Service: A Sample Microservice

The Reservation Service will be responsible for reading and writing data using the tables in the reservation keyspace.

This implementation uses Apache Cassandra for its data storage via the DataStax Java Driver and the Spring Boot project for managing the service life cycle. It exposes a RESTful API documented via Swagger.

=== Deployment and Integration Considerations

==== Services, Keyspaces, and Clusters

*  use a keyspace per service to promote encapsulation

* create a database user per keyspace, such that each service can be easily configured to have exclusive read and write access to all of the tables in its associated keyspace.

* a shared deployment in which Reservation and Inventory Services are using a shared cluster for data storage.

//TODO add picture

==== Data Centers and Load Balancing

The corresponding cluster for a service should also have nodes in each data center where the service will be deployed, to enable the fastest possible access.

The keyspace used by a service will need to be configured with a number of replicas to be stored per data center, assuming the NetworkTopologyStrategy is the replication strategy in use.

//TODO add picture Multiple data center deployment
