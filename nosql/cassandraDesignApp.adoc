== Hotel Application Design

=== Cassandra and Microservice Architecture

* Encapsulation

Encapsulation could also be phrased as “services that are focused on doing one thing well” or the “single responsibility principle.”

* Autonomy

Refers to the ability to independently deploy each microservice without dependence on any other microservices.

* Scalability

Microservice architecture provides a lot of flexibility by giving you the ability to run more or fewer instances of a service dynamically according to demand.

=== Microservice Architecture for a Hotel Application

Steps:

* Identifying Bounded Contexts

Hotel domain and Reservation domain

* Identifying Services

 ** Hotel service
 ** Point of interest service
 ** Inventory service
 ** Reservation service
 ** Guest service

Note:  assign tables that have a high degree of correspondence to the same service
