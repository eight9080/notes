= Event-Driven Systems

Kafka provides an asynchronous protocol for connecting programms together.

*A broker* is a separate piece of infrastructure that broadcasts messages to any programs that are interested in them, as well as storing them for as long as is needed.

*Events are business facts that have value to more than one service and are worth keeping around.*

A Kafka cluster is a *distributed system* at heart, providing high availability, storage, and linear scale-out.

Kafka is designed to move data, operating on that data as it does so. Itâ€™s about real-time processing first, long-term storage second.

*Kafka is a streaming platform*
