= Architecture Principles

 Enterprise Principles:: provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise, and inform how the organization sets about fulfilling its mission

 Architecture Principles:: are a set of principles that relate to architecture work

== Components of Architecture Principles


|===
|Name | Should both represent the essence of the rule as well as be easy to remember. Specific technology platforms should not be mentioned in the name or statement of a principle. Avoid ambiguous words in the Name and in the Statement such as: "support", "open", "consider", and for lack of good measure the word "avoid", itself, be careful with "manage(ment)", and look for unnecessary adjectives and adverbs (fluff).

|Statement
| Should succinctly and unambiguously communicate the fundamental rule. For the most part, the principles statements for managing information are similar from one organization to the next. It is vital that the principles statement is unambiguous.

|Rationale

|Should highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle, using business terminology. Point to the similarity of information and technology principles to the principles governing business operations. Also describe the relationship to other principles, and the intentions regarding a balanced interpretation. Describe situations where one principle would be given precedence or carry more weight than another for making a decision.


|Implications
| Should highlight the requirements, both for the business and IT, for carrying out the principle — in terms of resources, costs, and activities/tasks. It will often be apparent that current systems, standards, or practices would be incongruent with the principle upon adoption. The impact to the business and consequences of adopting a principle should be clearly stated. The reader should readily discern the answer to: "How does this affect me?". It is important not to oversimplify, trivialize, or judge the merit of the impact. Some of the implications will be identified as potential impacts only, and may be speculative rather than fully analyzed.

== Qualities of Principles

* *Understandable*: the underlying tenets can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization
The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous, so that violations, whether intentional or not, are minimized.
* *Robust*: enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made, and enforceable policies and standards to be created
Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision- making in complex, potentially controversial situations.
* *Complete*: every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined — the principles cover every situation perceived

* *Consistent*: strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle

* *Stable*: principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate changes
