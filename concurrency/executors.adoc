= Executor Framework

The Executor Framework provides several classes e.g. Executor, ExecutorService, and Executors for execution and creating thread pools. +
It also provides several built-in, ready to use thread pools like a pool of fixed threads, cached thread pool which can expand itself, spawn new threads if required due to heavy load.

The Job of that thread pool is to accept the task and execute if there is a free worker thread available, but ForJoinPool is a special kind of thread pool. They use a work-stealing pattern. All threads in a fork-join pool attempt to find and execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active tasks.

The main difference between the Executor framework and ForkJoinPool is that the former provides a general-purpose thread pool, while the latter provides a special implementation that uses a work-stealing pattern for efficient processing of ForkJoinTask.

== ForkJoinPool vs Executor Framework
1. The main difference between ForkJoinPool and ThreadPoolExecutor is that ForkJoinPool is designed to accept and execute ForkJoinTask, which is a lightweight version of FutureTask, +
while ThreadPoolExecutor is designed to provide a normal thread pool which executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled threads.

2. ForkJoinPool uses a work-stealing pattern, which means one thread can also execute a pending task from another thread. This improves efficiency in the case of ForkJoinTask as most of the ForkJoinTask algorithm spawn new tasks.

3. Some of the common ThreadPoolExecutor provided by JDK API is *SingleThreadExecutor*, which is a thread pool of just one background thread, *a cached thread pool* provided by Executors.newCachedThreadPool, which is a pool of unbounded threads, where the pool can spawn new threads if needed and reclaim old threads when not needed.

The third type of common use of ThreadPoolExecutor is a fixed thread pool, where the pool has *a fixed number of threads* in its lifetime, it's also an example of a bounded thread pool.

== Thread Pool

A thread pool is a collection of threads that can be used to execute tasks.

A thread pool is responsible for managing the creation, allocation, and life cycles of its threads and contributing to better performance.

== Executor Pattern

* Creating pools of ready to use threads and using them
* Pass a task to a pool of threads that will execute it

[source,java]
----
public interface ExecutorService extends Executor{
// 11 methods
}
----

Factory class -> `Executors`

----
ExecutorService singleThreadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
----

Creates a pool of thread with only one thread ->
This thread is created also and will be kept alive as long as this pool of thread is alive

When we pass a task to this ExecutorService, this task will be executed in that thread and this thread will now be destroyed once this task is done.

----
ExecutorService multipleThreadsExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadExecutor(8);
----

FixedThreadPoolExecutor -> pool of threads in which you can fix the number of thread

Example
----
ExecutorService singleThreadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Runanble task = () -> System.out.println("run");
executor.execute(task);
----

An Executor has to *waiting queue*

* A task is added to the waiting queue when no thread is available.
* The tasks are executed in the order of their submission

A task can be removed from the waiting queue -> If the task has been started by the thread, it is not possible to cancel it.

* Runnable as a task -> cannot return anything or raise an exception
* There is no way to know when the task is done.

=== ThreadPoolExecutor

A fully-fledged implementation of ExecutorService, named ThreadPoolExecutor.

----
ThreadPoolExecutor(
  int corePoolSize,
  int maximumPoolSize,
  long keepAliveTime,
  TimeUnit unit,
  BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,
  ThreadFactory threadFactory,
  RejectedExecutionHandler handler)
----

* _corePoolSize_: The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle (unless allowCoreThreadTimeOut is set)
* _maximumPoolSize_: The maximum number of allowed threads
* _keepAliveTime_: When this time has elapsed, the idle threads will be removed from the pool (these are idle threads that exceed corePoolSize)
* _unit_: The time unit for the keepAliveTime argument
* _workQueue_: A queue for holding the instances of Runnable (only the Runnable tasks submitted by the execute() method) before they are executed
* _threadFactory_: This factory is used when the executor creates a new thread
* _handler_: When ThreadPoolExecutor cannot execute a Runnable due to saturation, this is when the thread bounds and queue capacities are full (for example, workQueue has a fixed size and maximumPoolSize is set as well)â€”it gives the control and decision to this handler

Optimization:

* Number of CPUs (Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors())
* Target CPU utilization (in range, [0, 1])
* Wait time (W)
* Compute time (C)

----
Number of threads = Number of CPUs * Target CPU utilization * (1 + W/C)
----

*For _compute-intensive tasks_ (usually small tasks), it can be a good idea to benchmark the thread pool with the number of threads equal with to number of processors or number of processors + 1 (to prevent potential pauses).*


*For _time-consuming and blocking tasks_ (for example, I/O), a larger pool is better since threads will not be available for scheduling at a high rate. Also, pay attention to interferences with other pools (for example, database connections pools, and socket connection pools).*

=== Callable interface

[source, java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V>{
    V call() throws Exception;
}

public interface ExecutorService extends Executor{
 <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);
}
----

Example
----
Callable<String> task = () -> buildReport();
Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
String result = future.get();
----

The Future object is returned by the submit to the main thread.

Future.get -> blocking method, returns the object returned by the task:

* can throw InterruptedException
* in the case the task throws an exception, it is wrapped in an ExecutionException and re-thrown

Get also can receive a timeout.

=== Thread pool via Executors

`newSingleThreadExecutor` - a thread pool that manages only one thread with an *unbounded queue*, which only executes one task at a time

`ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();`

*Cached Thread Pool* `newCachedThreadPool`

* creates threads on demand
* keeps unused threads for 60s
* then terminates them
* the core pool size is 0 and the maximum pool size is Integer.MAX_VALUE

`ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();`

`newFixedThreadPool()` - a thread pool with a fixed number of threads and an *unbounded queue*

* the core pool size and the maximum pool size are equal to the specified size

`ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);`

`newWorkStealingThreadPool()` - a thread pool based on a work-stealing algorithm (it acts as a layer over a fork/join framework)

`ExecutorService executor = Executors.newWorkStealingPool();`


*Scheduled Thread Pool* `newScheduledThreadPool(poolSize)`

* creates a pool of threads
* returns a ScheduledExecutorService

The ScheduledExecutorService - is an ExecutorService that can schedule tasks for execution after a given delay, or execute periodically.

* schedule(task,delay)
* scheduleAtFixedRate(task,delay,period)
* scheduleWithFixedRate(task,initialDelay, delay)

`ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);`

===== Use cases

A large number of small tasks: *work-stealing thread pool* (best results),
fixed thread pool, cache thread pool(worse)

A small number of time-consuming tasks: the work-stealing thread pool worked as a regular thread pool, cache(worse)

==== Shutting down

* `shutdown()`:

** continue to execute all submitted tasks
** execute waiting tasks
** do not accept new tasks
** the shutdown

* `shutdownNow()`:

** halt the running tasks
** do not execute waiting tasks
** do not accept new tasks
** the shutdown

* `awaitTermination(timeout)`:

** shutdown()
** wait for the timeout
** if still remaining tasks -> halt everything
