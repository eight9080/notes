= ForkJoinPool

== Overview
The fork-join pool provides a high performance, fine-grained task execution framework for Java data parallelism.

.Solve (problem)

 if (problem is small enough)
    solve problem directly
            (sequential algorithm)
 else
    split problem into independent parts
    fork new sub-tasks to solve each part
    join all sub-tasks
    compose result from sub-results

Subtasks:

* run in parallel on different cores
* can also run concurrently in different threads on a single core

Join - waits for a sub-tasks to finish & merge the results

=== Framework

* a larger task -> can be divided into smaller ones + the sub-solutions can be combined
* subtasks have to be independent in order to be executed in parallel
* fork-join framework breaks the task into the smallest sub-tasks until these subtasks are simple enough to solve without further breakups

== Structure

=== ForkJoinPool Class

ForkJoinPool implements ExecutorService interface +
Other implementations of ExecutorService execute runnables or callables.

The ForkJoinPool executes *ForkJoinTasks*

==== ForkJoinTask

image::forkJoinTaskHierarchy.png[Hierarchy]

* associates a chunk of data along with a computation of that data
* is lighter weight than a Java thread

fork() doesn't run the task, but places it on a *work queue* in the calling worker thread.

join()

* returns the result of a child task to the parent task that forked it.
* doesn't block the calling thread
* it uses a worker thread to run tasks

==== Methods of ForkJoinPool

Clients insert new fork-join tasks onto a fork-join pool's shared queued, which feeds work-stealing queues managed by worker threads.

|===
|void | `execute(ForkJoinTask<T>)`| async execution
|T    | `invoke(ForkJoinTask<T>)`| performs the given task, returning its result upon completion
|ForkJoinTask<T>    | `submit(ForkJoinTask<T>)`| submits a ForkJoinTask for execution, returns a Future
|===

The ForkJoinPool size defaults to the number of cores available to Java runtime.

==== Methods of ForkJoinTask

fork()

- enables a task to create sub-tasks that run in parallel
- pushes the task on the head of the deque owned by the current worker thread

join()

- returns the result of a previously fork'd computation when it is done
- defines a sync point

invoke() - sync computation

==== Sub classes of ForkJoinTask

RecursiveAction - does not return a result
`void compute()`

RecursiveTask - does return a result
`V compute()`


=== Worker Threads

Each worker thread runs a loop to get work

A worker thread has a double ended queue ( deque ) that servers as its main source of tasks.

If a task run by a worker thread calls `fork()` the new task is pushed on the head of the worker's deque.

A worker thread processes its deque in LIFO order. (stack)

`join()` - pitches in to pop & execute sub-tasks

=== Work Stealing

Worker threads only block if there are no tasks available to run.

Each worker thread checks other dequeues in the pool to find other tasks to run.

To maximize core utilization, idle worker threads steal work from the tail of busy threads' dequeues. (poll method)

Tasks are stolen in FIFO order. (queue)
