== Hierarchy of Collection and Map, Concurrent Interfaces

Collection and Map branches

image::collection/collection.png[Collection hierarchy]

Map

* SortedMap -> navigableMap
* ConcurrentMap -> ConcurrentNavigableMap

== Concurrent Lists

=== Vector abd Stacks
* thread safe structures
* legacy structures
* all the methods are synchronized
* one thread is reading a vector, no other thread can access it, whether for read operations or write operations

=== Copy On Write Arrays

* No locking for read operations
* write operations create a new structure
* new structure replaces the previous one
* internally a copy of the existing structure and the new structure replaces the previous one by just moving a pointer from the old structure to the new one in a synchronized way

* So the new read operations will see this new structure while there are other threads iterating over the previous one, they will not see the modification.

* CopyOnWriteArraylist
* CopyOnWriteArraySet

* recommend for many reads and very few writes

Example: application initialization

=== Queues and Stacks

Queue and Deque - interfaces

*ArrayBlockingQueue* - a bounded blocking queue built on an array

* Bounded means that we create a blocking queue with a certain amount of cells, a certain size of the array, and once this queue is full, it does not extend itself. Adding elements to it would not be possible.

*ConcurrentLinkedQueue* - an unbounded blocking queue

Types:

* the FIFO, First In First Out -  the queue itself
* the LIFO, Last In First Out - the stack

The queue is the interface for the Queue +
The Deque is the interface for both a queue and a stack

Suppose we want to add an element to a queue that is full:

* cannot occur with ConcurrentLinkedQueue

* can occur with ArrayBlockingQueue
* boolean add(E e); //fail IllegalArgumentException
* boolean offer(E e); // fail return false
* boolean offer(E e, timeout, timeunit); // fail return false

* if the queue is a BlockingQueue
void put(E e); //blocks until a cell becomes available

Deque can accept elements at the head of a queue:

* addFirst(), offerFirst()

And for the *BlokingDeque*

* putFirst()

==== Other operations

* *get* is to remove an element from a queue
* *peek* is just to examine an element without removing it from the queue.

If queue is empty:

* poll() and peek() returns *null*
* remove() and element() - throw an exception

If BlockingQueue is empty:
* take() - blocks until an element is available.

If deque is empty:

* pollLast() and peeklast() returns *null*
* removeLast() and getlast() - throw an exception

If BlockingDeque is empty:

* takeLast() - blocks until an element is available

== Concurrent Maps

* ConcurrentHashMap
    ** defines atomic operations
        *** putIfAbsent(key, value)
        *** remove(key, value)
        *** replace(key, value)
        *** replace(key, existingValue, newValue)

* ConcurrentSkipListMap


=== ConcurrentHashMap

* thread safe
* efficient

A hashmap is built on an array.

1. compute a hashcode from the key
2. decide which cell will hold the key/value pair
3. check if the key is there or not
4. Update the map

Each cell is called a bucket.

==== Parallel Search

[source]
----
 ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, UUID> concurrentHashMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
int threshold = 10;

concurrentHashMap.forEachValue(threshold, System.out::println);

String searchResult = concurrentHashMap.search(threshold, (id, uuid) -> {
      if (String.valueOf(uuid).contains(String.valueOf(id))) {
        return new String(id + ":" + uuid);
      }
      return null;
    });
----
If this operation returns a non-null value, this value will be returned by the search method and it will stop the exploration of the map.

*Parallelism threshold* - the number of key value pairs in this map that will trigger a parallel search.

* searchKeys, searchValues, and searchEntries

==== Parallel Map / Reduce

----
ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    map.putIfAbsent("foo", "bar");
    map.putIfAbsent("han", "solo");
    map.putIfAbsent("r2", "d2");
    map.putIfAbsent("c3", "p0");

    String reduced = map.reduce(1, (key, value) -> key + "=" + value,
            (s1, s2) -> s1 + ", " + s2);
----

1. maps the element
2. reduces two elements

==== Parallel ForEach

----
HashMap<String, Integer> mapcon= new HashMap<>();
mapcon.put("k1", 100);
mapcon.put("k2", 200);
mapcon.put("k3", 300);
mapcon.put("k4", 400);

mapcon.forEach( 2, (k, v) -> v.removeIf(s -> s==100); //foreach function
----

* forEachKeys that takes a consumer of key
* forEachValues that takes a consumer values
* forEachEntry that takes a consumer of entry

==== Creating a Concurrent Set on a Java 8 ConcurrentHashMap

----
Set<string> set = ConcurrentHashMap.<String>newKeySet();
----

== Concurrent skip list

A skip list is a smart structure used to create linked lists and to provide fast random access to any of its elements.

The concurrent version of this skip list implemented in Java 6 relies on atomic reference operations and no synchronization is used in it.

The solution this skip lists brings is to create a fast access list with less elements on top of it.

* create several layer of such a fast access list
* the elements of the skip list are sorted

Access time O(logN)

Implementations:

* ConcurrentSkipListMap
    ** the references in this skip list are implemented using AtomicReference

* ConcurrentSkipListSet
