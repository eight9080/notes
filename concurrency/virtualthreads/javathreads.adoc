= Java Threads

== Task types

* IO Bound
* CPU Bound

* Process per request
* Thread per request

Each user request blocks a thread from a thread pool.

=== Thread per User Request

* Thread is lightweight  - but has its own stack
* can handle larger number of concurrent users
* can share data or communicate between threads
* improved performance - no extra process to deal with
* easy to debug (ish)

== Concurrency vs Parallelism
=== Concurrency

* multiple independent tasks are making progress but may not execute at the same time
* appearance of parallelism
* CPU  time slicing

=== Parallelism

* multiple dependent sub tasks are executing at the same time
* multiple cores needed
* no parallelism in a single core

== Java Platform Threads

* the stack size of 1 MB - common

* every java thread is a wrapper around an OS Thread (OS thread is an expensive resource)
* Stack memory size can be set `-Xss`
* Heap Memory can be set `-Xmx, -Xms`

=== Threads and Scalability

* default stack size 1M
* there is a max limit to the maz threads
    ** much more soket connections can be supported
* IO bound tasks
    ** paralyzes the OS thread for a longer time than necessary

=== Scalability Solutions

==== Vertical Scaling

* Increase resources: CPU Memory Disk Space
* Limit to scaling
* Increases costs

==== Horizontal Scaling
* increase number of application nodes
* no limit
* Costly

=== Non Blocking IO

A new Callback handler is called to handle the results.
