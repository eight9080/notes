= Parallel Functional Programming

== Concepts

*Throughput* - how much work is done in a given unit of time

*Scalability* - how well a task can be broken up and run on multiple processor cores

*Latency* - the time required to wait for something and then to perform the operation

When to use:

* when tasks are independent
* when there is lots of data to be processed
* when threads neither block nor share mutable state
* when there are many cores

*Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.*

An application can be concurrent — but not parallel, which means that it processes more than one task at the same time, but no two tasks are executing at the same time instant.

An application can be parallel — but not concurrent, which means that it processes multiple sub-tasks of a task in multi-core CPU at the same time.
