==== Compressing files
Compression algorithms
* Lossless - preserves all the data contained in the original.
This means that when a file is restored from a compressed version, the restored file is exactly the same as the original, uncompressed version.
* Lossy - removes data as the compression is performed to allow more compression to be applied.
When a lossy file is restored, it does not match the original version; rather, it is a close approximation.
Examples of lossy compression are JPEG (for images) and MP3 (for music).
