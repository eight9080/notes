= Java Multithreading

== Concepts

*Concurrency* - achieved by multi-tasking between threads

*Parallelism* - with multiple cores tasks can be run in parallel

A process - is isolated from other process
A process ( context ):

*Stack* - region in memory where local variables are stored and passed into functions

*Instruction pointer* - address of the next instruction to execute

*Context switch*

* is not cheap to switch between threads execution
* each thread consumes resources in the CPU and memory

*Thread scheduling*

OS divides the times into Epochs

*Dynamic priority* = Static priority + Bonus

Static priority = set by dev programmatically
Bonus - adjusted by OS in every epoch by each thread

* Thread vs process
Threads share a lot of data, faster to switch between threads

== Thread termination
