= JVM Garbage Collectors

Garbage Collection tracks each and every object available in the JVM heap space and removes unused ones.

* *Mark* – it is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not
* *Sweep* – this step removes objects identified during the “mark” phase

== Types of Garbage Collector

JVM has four types of GC implementations:

* Serial Garbage Collector
* Parallel Garbage Collector
* CMS Garbage Collector
* G1 Garbage Collector

===  Serial Garbage Collector

* it basically works with *a single thread*.
* It works by holding all the threads of an application.
* this GC implementation freezes all application threads when it runs. -> *stop the world event*
* not a good idea to use it in multi-threaded applications like server environments.

To enable:
----
java -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar Application.java
----

===  Parallel Garbage Collector

* default GC of the JVM and sometimes called *Throughput Collectors*
* uses *multiple threads* for managing heap space. But it also freezes other application threads while performing GC.
* It is used if we want to execute a long process (like batch processing) and where long pauses are acceptable

Properties:

- numbers of garbage collector threads `XX:ParallelGCThreads=<N>.`
- maximum pause time goal (gap [in milliseconds] between two GC) `XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<N>`
- maximum throughput target (measured regarding the time spent doing garbage collection versus the time spent outside of garbage collection)  `-XX:GCTimeRatio=<N>.`
- maximum heap footprint (the amount of heap memory that a program requires while running) `-Xmx<N>`

To enable:
----
java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar Application.java
----

===  Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector

* uses multiple garbage collector threads for garbage collection.
* It's designed for applications that prefer *shorter garbage collection pauses*, and that can afford to *share processor resources* with the garbage collector while the application is running.
* It does not freeze the application's threads during the garbage collection.

To enable:
----
java -XX:+UseParNewGC -jar Application.java
----

Java 9 - deprecated, Java 14 - removed

=== G1 Garbage Collector
* designed for applications running on multi-processor machines with large memory space (more than 4GB).
* G1 collector will replace the CMS collector since it's more performance efficient.

* G1 collector partitions the heap into a set of equal-sized heap regions (usually 1MB to 32MB), each a contiguous range of virtual memory.
* When performing garbage collections, G1 shows a concurrent global marking phase (i.e. phase 1 known as Marking) to determine the liveness of objects throughout the heap.
* After the mark phase is completed, G1 knows which regions are mostly empty. It collects in these areas first, which usually yields a significant amount of free space (i.e. phase 2 known as Sweeping).
* Garbage-First.

=== Strings

Reducing the unnecessary use of memory by creating too many instances of the same String:`-XX:+UseStringDeduplication` as a JVM parameter.
